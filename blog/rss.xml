&lt;h2&gt;40. The Transition to Release Leads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From late 2011 on, the development process iterated. Not optimal, it lacked accountability. Bottlenecks festered and deadlines passed. Each release from WordPress 3.4 on endured major development process change; it wasn’t until WordPress 3.8 that process experimentation slowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimentation started at the core team meetup in Tybee Island, Georgia, in December 2011. Lead developers, committers, and active core developers discussed the project’s issues and roadmap, informing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&amp;amp;day=2012-01-04&amp;amp;sort=asc#m349775&quot;&gt;scope setting meeting for WordPress 3.4&lt;/a&gt; on January 4, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope chat notes cover the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/01/05/dev-chat-notes-01042012/&quot;&gt;issues discussed&lt;/a&gt;. The team acknowledged process problems. Jen listed the issues: “lack of good time estimation, resource bottlenecks, lack of accountability, unknown/variable time commitments/disappearing devs, overassignment of tasks to some people, reluctance to cut features to meet deadline.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They split feature development into teams; two contributors would lead each team to reduce contributor overextension and project abandonment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a lead developer or a committer would lead each feature team. To help engage and mentor new contributors, one new contributor would pair with each lead or committer. Each team had to post regular updates and deliver their feature on time. They created a schedule with overlapping cycles that encompassed development, UX, and bug fixes to reduce bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/41/3_4_dev_process.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The proposal for the 3.4 release process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team decided that releases would have a specific focus. WordPress 3.3 had been a cluster of disparate features, some of which had been pulled because they weren&apos;t ready. WordPress 3.4 was the first cycle to have an overarching focus -- appearance/switching themes. The development team worked on improving both front-end and admin features that adjust a site’s appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between WordPress 3.4 and 3.5, the project leadership approach evolved -- a change that had started back in WordPress 3.0 when Dion Hulse became a committer. Though Dion received commit access, he was not a lead developer. This was the first step toward decoupling the lead developer position from commit access. To reduce bottlenecks, the project needed committers, but not necessarily more lead developers. Separating the roles offered opportunities for strong coders and patch triagers, and for those who wanted to contribute, but not necessarily in a leadership role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, confusion reigned on what the lead developer title actually entailed. Core team members perceived the role differently; no one agreed on what the lead developer title meant. For Mark Jaquith, the lead developer role has changed organically over the years. To begin with, the role related to coding. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_22_Jaquith.html#L30&quot;&gt;Over time, it transitioned, particularly around the growth of WordCamps&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;We started going around and talking to users about some of the philosophy behind WordPress and the direction we wanted to take. It became more of a general leadership role in practice.&quot; The role also evolved as lead developers worked with the community: often, lead developers responded to comment threads to address issues, or speak up on behalf of the project.

However, the role had never been formally clarified. While the lead developers handled many coding decisions, their additional responsibilities and authority were unclear. Did they have authority across the project? Should they make decisions in areas such as WordCamps, documentation, or theme review?

The lead developer role &quot;didn&apos;t really have a set of responsibilities assigned with it or expectations,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_07_07_Mullenweg.html#L214&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, the lead developer leads development, not other areas of the project; he believes that confering authority and responsibility to a development role makes it difficult for non-coders to achieve project authority and responsibility. 		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html&quot;&gt;Matt had articulated as much, as early as 2005&lt;/a&gt;, in stating that commit access did not equate to community status. It may never have been Matt’s intention to automatically confer authority on people with commit access, though extending commit demonstrated that committers had earned trust, and, as such, people naturally looked to committers as community and code leaders. Since roles and responsibilities were undefined, people simply perceived commit access as a general leadership role. The only non-coder who had an official leadership role in the project -- other than the lead developers -- was Jen, but she was an integral part of the core development team and there was no clear path for anyone to follow in her footsteps.

In June 2012, the confusion around the role brought conflict. Since WordPress 3.0, a new generation of coders had driven development. Contributor changes were marked between the 2010 core meetup in Orlando, Florida, and the 2011 meetup in Tybee Island, Georgia. In 2010, just the small team of lead developers (Mark Jaquith, Andrew Ozz, Peter Westwood, Matt, and Ryan Boren along with Jen) met up. In 2011, the meetup had new faces including Dion Hulse, Jon Cave (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_&quot;&gt;duck_&lt;/a&gt;), Daryl Koopersmith, and Andrew Nacin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, someone arrives and influences the project. In the early days, Ryan Boren drove WordPress&apos; development, but post-WordPress 3.0, it was Andrew Nacin. &quot;Nacin like Ryan is one of those guys that just has an ability to get in a flow, and just really crank and get focused intensely, and get through a ton of work,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_07_07_Mullenweg.html#L196&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nacin’s project influence grew, and between WordPress 3.4 and 3.5, Ryan Boren proposed that since Nacin drove releases strongly, he deserved recognition and should be made a lead developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than appoint Nacin as a lead developer immediately, Matt proposed an organizational shift in the project. Matt argued that the lead developer title was historical and non-meritocratic, that those driving the project should hold leadership roles. Matt wanted opportunities for new developers to assume project leadership roles. He proposed that, instead of having a small group of lead developers, the project move to release leads, nominating Andrew Nacin and Daryl Koopersmith to assume the role in the next release. Matt&apos;s proposal offered clear authority to individuals for a given release; release leads would have final say, both over the lead developers, and over Matt. Some in the &quot;historical and un-meritocratic&quot; roles perceived this move as an attempt to remove the old guard to make way for the new. While a number of the lead developers aren’t active in core on a daily basis, they are in regular contact with those who work on core, providing advice on architecture and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reflection, Matt says that there was a misunderstanding. He didn&apos;t mean to imply that the people holding lead developer roles were worthless or irrelevant, but that the roles did not reflect project reality. &quot;A source of some of the conflict,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_07_07_Mullenweg.html#L214&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;is this idea that the lead developers sort of had the same role as me where they had sort of purview over everything across all parts of WordPress.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead developer role discussion raised dissatisfaction around project decision making. Many of those who ran day-to-day development felt that unilateral decisions were made without team consultation. Matt had taken a less active role in recent years, as Jen and Ryan, supported by the other lead developers, drove the project, yet decisions were made and announced without consultation. This was a culmination of other issues within the core development team and in the wider project: checking in code without consultation, providing feedback only toward the end of a release, and decisions around WordPress.org -- the site Matt owns, but that influences the entire community.

In response, some core team members -- including lead developers and other team members -- sent a group email to Matt to express their discontent with the project. They felt that Matt’s perspective on the project&apos;s organization, authority, and responsibility, didn’t reflect the project&apos;s realities. The group proposed an official project leadership team; they wanted to retain the lead developer title as a meritocratic title for core developers who aligned with WordPress&apos; philosophies, demonstrated leadership, code expertise, and mentored new developers. While the group happily supported the release leads proposal, they felt that the decisions for architecture, code, and implementation should rest with the lead developers, and that decisions affecting the project should lie with a leadership team.

In response, those involved scheduled a Google Hangout to discuss the issues, air grievances, and find a way forward. As a result, things changed, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/07/11/recognition-and-news-about-the-3-5-cycle/&quot;&gt;first 3.5 release cycle post&lt;/a&gt; reflects some of those changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Nacin was promoted to lead developer, and core development adopted release leads with responsibility for an individual release cycle. They chose media as the scope for the 3.5 release; the development team had wanted to tackle it for some time, but with such a large scope, it hadn&apos;t been attempted. Daryl Koopersmith created a plugin, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/mosaic/&quot;&gt;Mosaic&lt;/a&gt;, which was the prototype for new media management. Much of it was written in JavaScript, where Daryl&apos;s expertise lay. But as a PHP free software project, there were few who could help him. As a result, Andrew and Daryl spent between 80 - 100 hours a week working on the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the release itself was well received and media was overhauled, the actual development cycle wasn&apos;t such a success. It was a huge amount of work, involving lots of feedback, codebase iterations, and coding a whole new feature from scratch. There were four major iterations to the user interface, including one 72 hours before the release. This meant that the new &quot;release leads approach&quot; got off to a faltering start. The intent was to have  release leads guide and lead a release, not necessarily spend hours carrying out heroic coding feats. Once again, the release cycle focused on a single feature; it shipped because two coders broke their backs getting it done. But the next release cycle -- 3.6 -- revealed that the release-specific feature development model was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;41. The Community Summit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first en-masse, invitation-only WordPress community get-together -- The Community Summit -- took place in 2012. The Community Summit focused on issues facing WordPress software development and the wider WordPress community. Community members nominated themselves and others to receive an invitation; a team of 18 people reviewed and voted on who would be invited. The attendees -- active contributors, bloggers, plugin and theme developers, and business owners from across the WordPress community -- came to Tybee Island, Georgia, to talk about WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main event, held at Tybee wedding chapel, was a one-day unconference. A few informal days for project work were scheduled afterward. In the morning, attendees pitched suggestions for discussion, discussion groups formed around tables, and twice during the day, individual groups shared their proposals for taking action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects discussed covered the spectrum of development and community issues. Development-specific topics included mobile apps, improving deployments, using WordPress as a framework, multisite, JavaScript, the theme customizer, and automatic updates. They talked about how to deepen developer experience, including better information for developers on UI practices. Broader community discussions focused on the role of the WordPress Foundation, open sourcing WordCamp.org, the GPL, and women in the WordPress community. There were discussions about different WordPress.org teams, such as UI, accessibility, theme review, and about improving documentation. Summit participants came from around the world; attendees talked about internationalization and global communities. Business owners raised issues such as managed WordPress hosting and quality control in commercial plugins. Finally, there were discussions about making it easier for both individuals and businesses to contribute to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so much discussion, many different ideas surfaced. Some proposed ideas moved forward, while others languished lacking contributor support. Summit discussions resulted in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better theme review process documentation to increase consistency and transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A documentation and Codex roadmap (developer.wordpress.org eventually launched).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language packs included in core in WordPress 4.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headers added to the P2 themes to instruct contributors on how to get involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published a make/events sub-team list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic updates for core.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Individual plugin reviews on WordPress.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open sourced the WordCamp.org base theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as creating a space for contributors to discuss issues, many contributors met for the first time at the summit, and the in-person talks invigorated the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new team -- a plugin repository review team -- formed. Up until then, Mark Riley carried the load reviewing plugins for the repository. The community believed plugins required the same rigor as themes. Plugin code quality was raised on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/is-a-plugin-validation-team-a-pipe-dream&quot;&gt;community blogs&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-August/034146.html&quot;&gt;wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;.  Otto started to review plugins too, and later Mika Epstein (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/ipstenu&quot;&gt;ipstenu&lt;/a&gt;) and Pippin Williamson (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/mordauk&quot;&gt;mordauk&lt;/a&gt;) helped conduct plugin reviews. Later, Boone Gorges (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges/&quot;&gt;boonebgorges&lt;/a&gt;) and Scott Riley (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/coffee2code&quot;&gt;coffee2code&lt;/a&gt;) joined the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin review team faces different challenges than the theme review team. A theme is a specific group of template files with a defined structure. It calls functions, it requires a header, footer, and a sidebar. A plugin can be anything at all, so there’s no way to automate reviews, which can be a lot of work. This review process cleared out malicious plugins, spam plugins, and plugins with security holes. A set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/&quot;&gt;guidelines evolved&lt;/a&gt; to protect WordPress users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a small group of contributors created a team to address a specific project need. This has continued ever since the summit; a team develops training programs for people who want to teach WordPress, a team moderates WordPress.tv, and there&apos;s a team of contributors who help to support meetups. The summit allowed people to get together, to talk about their own interests, meet like-minded contributors, and move projects forward. The community got to be together as a community, to get to know one another socially -- instead of through text-based, online communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;42. The Spirit of the GPL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By early 2013, the GPL discussion had slowed. Not everyone liked it, but most accepted that the WordPress project would only support 100% GPL products. Many were surprised by a sudden flare-up around not just GPL legalities, but the “spirit” of the license. In a 2008 interview, Jeff Chandler asked Matt about the spirit of the GPL. Matt said that the spirit of the GPL is about user empowerment, about the four freedoms: to use, distribute, modify, and distribute modifications of the software. Software distributed with these four freedoms is in the spirit of the GPL. WordPress was created and distributed in this spirit, giving users full freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Software Freedom Law Center&apos;s opinion gives developers a loophole around themes -- one that helps them achieve GPL compliance -- but denies the same freedoms as WordPress. PHP in themes must be GPL, but the CSS, images, and JavaScript do not have to be GPL. This is how Thesis released with a split license -- the PHP was GPL; the remaining code and files were proprietary. This split license ensures GPL-compliance, but does not embrace the GPL&apos;s driving user-freedom ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loophole may have kept theme sellers GPL-compliant, but WordPress.org rejected that approach. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/2010/03/09/mullenweg-little-wordpress-interview/&quot;&gt;In a 2010 interview&lt;/a&gt;, Matt said “in the philosophy there are no loopholes: you’re either following the principles of it or you’re not, regardless of what the specific license of the language is.&quot; WordPress supports theme sellers that sell themes with a 100% GPL license. Those who aren’t 100% GPL receive no promotion on WordPress.org or on official resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2013, ThemeForest -- Envato&apos;s theme marketplace -- came under scrutiny. Envato runs blogs and marketplaces that sell everything from WordPress themes and plugins, themes for other CMSs, to photographs, videos, and illustrations. WordPress is just one aspect of their business, though a significant one, and ever-growing. Envato  became GPL-compliant in 2009 by releasing their themes with two licenses: GPL for the PHP, and a proprietary license for the remaining files and code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThemeForest has long been a popular choice for individual theme sellers. It offers exposure and access to a huge user community. As the theme shop marketplace saturated, it became more and more difficult for new theme sellers to break through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme shops like StudioPress, WooThemes, and Elegant Themes dominate the market. ThemeForest offers everything a theme seller needs: hosting, sales tools, ecommerce, and a shop front. People can sell themes without the set-up work that can steal so much time. Theme sellers make good money out of selling on ThemeForest. As early as December 2011, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://notes.envato.com/milestones/kriesi-first-to-1000000-on-the-marketplaces/&quot;&gt;announced its first theme seller to make a million dollars in theme sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2013, ThemeForest author Jake Caputo received an email from Andrea Middleton (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/andreamiddleton/&quot;&gt;andreamiddleton&lt;/a&gt;) at WordCamp Central. He was told that, as a ThemeForest author, he was not allowed to participate at official WordPress events. Jake had already spoken at two WordCamps, had plans to speak at a third, and was helping to organize WordCamp Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue was over theme licensing and WordCamp&apos;s guidelines. WordCamps are official WordPress events that come with the WordPress Foundation&apos;s seal of approval. &lt;a href=&quot;http://plan.wordcamp.org/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/&quot;&gt;Organizers, volunteers, and  speakers&lt;/a&gt; must fully embrace the GPL -- going beyond GPL compliance to pass on all WordPress&apos; freedoms to users. The guidelines state that organizers, volunteers, and speakers must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Embrace the WordPress license. If distributing WordPress-derivative works (themes, plugins, WP distros), any person or business should give their users the same freedoms that WordPress itself provides. Note: this is one step above simple compliance, which requires PHP code to be GPL/compatible but allows proprietary licenses for JavaScript, CSS, and images. 100% GPL or compatible is required for promotion at WordCamps when WordPress-derivative works are involved, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThemeForest vendors had only the split license, in which the PHP was GPL and the CSS, JavaScript, and images fell under a proprietary license. For Jake to become 100% GPL, he would have to stop selling on ThemeForest and find a new outlet for his themes. This meant losing access to the more than two million ThemeForest members -- not to mention a significant portion of his income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamp Central&apos;s actions angered some community members; some thought it was unfair to ask theme sellers to give up their livelihood simply to speak at a WordCamp. Others supported WordPress.org; they believed the stance consistent with the GPL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both sides, people were frustrated for ThemeForest&apos;s authors. While the issue had little influence on the powers-that-be at WordPress or Envato, theme authors stuck in the middle suffered. With only the split license at Themeforest, they had one choice -- jeopardize their short-term livelihood by moving off ThemeForest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument raged in the comments of Jake&apos;s blog, spiralling to other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poststat.us/what-now-for-commercial-theme-authors/&quot;&gt;WordPress community blogs&lt;/a&gt;, and to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/wordpressorg-bans-themeforest-members-from-participating-in-official-wordcamp-gatherings/85648?page=2&quot;&gt;ThemeForest forums&lt;/a&gt;. Matt joined the discussion on Jake&apos;s blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.designcrumbs.com/automatically-blackballed#comment-430&quot;&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; if ThemeForest authors had a choice about licensing and could release their theme under the GPL, then &quot;Envato would still be breaking the guideline, but Jake wouldn&apos;t, so it&apos;d be fine for Jake to be involved with WordCamps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collis Ta&apos;eed, CEO of Envato, &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/themeforest-wordcamps/&quot;&gt;responded on WP Daily&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; outlining Envato&apos;s licensing model rationale. As a designer, Collis&apos; main concern is protecting his designers&apos; rights, while ensuring that customers can use the resources they purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with so many disagreements in the WordPress community, it came down to a difference in emphasis. While the WordPress project emphasizes user freedoms, Envato emphasizes creators&apos; rights. Both felt strongly that they had the moral imperative, and backing down meant violating the principles that underpinned their organization. The WordPress project places user freedoms over and above every thing else. If this meant excluding theme authors who sold on ThemeForest, then so be it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collis, on the other hand, wanted to make sure that theme authors felt confident that their themes were safe from piracy. He was also worried about having a GPL option for authors. He wrote, &quot;I worry that external pressures will force an increasing number of our authors to change their license choice, some happily, some not.&quot; Having just one (split) license meant that authors wouldn&apos;t be forced into that situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the project’s perspective, theme authors could choose to sell their themes on ThemeForest, or sell their themes under the WordPress community&apos;s ethos (and thus speak at WordCamps). &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcandy.com/podcasts/035-with-special-guest-jake-caputo/&quot;&gt;In a podcast on WP Candy&lt;/a&gt;, Jake said he didn&apos;t feel he had a choice about where to sell his themes. ThemeForest had become such an important part of his income that he would have to forfeit that income if he moved elsewhere. After the podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/theme-clarity/&quot;&gt;Collis wrote a second post on WP Daily&lt;/a&gt;, in which he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think I&apos;ve been wrong in my stance. I would like to change that stance, and feel that ThemeForest should offer an option for authors, if they choose, to sell their themes with a GPL license covering the entirety of the theme.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collis surveyed ThemeForest authors to gauge support for a GPL opt-in option. &quot;I felt pretty guilty that our authors were paying some sort of price for selling with us, that felt pretty wrong,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_11_Taeed.html#L86&quot;&gt;says Collis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://notes.envato.com/news/survey-results-about-gpl-opt-in-choice/&quot;&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; showed that verified authors were split; some said they would license their themes under the GPL, the same number said they would stick with the split license, and 35% said that they didn&apos;t know which license they&apos;d choose. On March 26, Collis announced a 100%-GPL license for ThemeForest authors. Jake was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.designcrumbs.com/un-blackballed&quot;&gt;once again allowed to speak at WordCamps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;43. The Problem with Post Formats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3.6 release cycle was challenging; it precipitated a new approach to the development process. Two core WordPress philosophies, &lt;em&gt;design for the majority&lt;/em&gt; and again, &lt;em&gt;deadlines are not arbitrary&lt;/em&gt;, were tested. The 3.6 release cycle process followed the cycle started in WordPress 3.4: there was a unified theme for the release -- this time &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/12/19/wordpress-3-6-cycle/&quot;&gt;content editing&lt;/a&gt;. Small teams worked on key features. Some features need more research and development than can be achieved within a single development cycle, and the WordPress 3.6 cycle surfaced this flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post formats were 3.6&apos;s headline feature. Introduced in WordPress 3.1., &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats&quot;&gt;post formats&lt;/a&gt; allow theme developers to lend a unique visual treatment to specific post types. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post formats lacked a standard user interface. In WordPress 3.6, release leads Mark Jaquith and Aaron Campbell tackled the problem. The release cycle had different stages: in the scoping chat, the release lead decided on the release&apos;s key features, created teams, and assigned feature leads. Feature leads ran their teams. The release leads coordinated with the teams and made the final decision on what made the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying out major user interface changes in just a few months is challenging, at best. WordPress 3.5 demonstrated that to meet the deadline, the release leads needed to put in heroic coding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3.6 release encountered problems; &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/02/19/dropping-editorial-flow/&quot;&gt;features were dropped&lt;/a&gt; as contributors discovered they&apos;d overcommitted themselves. The biggest issue was around the post formats user interface, inspired by Alex King’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2011/10/25/wordpress-post-formats-admin-ui&quot;&gt;Post Format Admin UI&lt;/a&gt;. Much thought and study went into the post formats UI. Which UI would offer users a logical, intuitive workflow, without adding needless complexity to the UI or the experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that despite time spent on wireframes and development, the team ended up unimpressed. They created specifications, built to the specifications, and were unhappy with the result. “It&apos;s like ordering something from the restaurant that sounds great,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_06_05_Campbell.html#L71&quot;&gt;says Aaron Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, “but as soon as it sits in front of you and you smell it, it&apos;s like, &apos;Ahh, definitely not what I was in the mood for.&apos;&quot; Even during WordPress 3.6&apos;s beta period, community members &lt;a href=&quot;http://ran.ge/2013/04/11/re-thinking-wordpress-post-format-ui-an-exercise/&quot;&gt;experimented with better approaches to the problem&lt;/a&gt;.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x3C;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/44/post-formats.jpg&quot; &quot;one of the proposals for the post formats UI&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The post formats user interface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 29 was WordPress 3.6&apos;s target release date. On April 23, Jen -- who had by that point stepped back from her involvement in development -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/04/23/post-formats-schedules-and-philosophy/&quot;&gt;said that post formats weren&apos;t ready&lt;/a&gt;. She said that the user interface was confusing, underscoring WordPress&apos; &lt;em&gt;deadlines are not arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; philosophy. The thread, in addition to highlighting the post formats UI flaws, showed that not everyone supported &lt;em&gt;deadlines are not arbitrary&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/04/23/post-formats-schedules-and-philosophy/#comment-8523&quot;&gt;Ryan Boren wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The four month deadline is so fanciful as to be arbitrary. It always has been. Historically, we just can’t do a major release with a marquee UI feature in that time, certainly not without heroic efforts of the 3.5 sort. So we end up facing decisions like this. Every single release we wonder if we have to punt the marquee feature. Punting often requires major surgery that can be as much work as finishing the feature. Punting is demoralizing. Four month releases are empty promises that bring us here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/05/29/post-formats-ui-is-exiting-core-will-live-as-a-plugin/&quot;&gt;Mark and Aaron pulled post formats&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of work had to go in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24452&quot;&gt;removing it from core&lt;/a&gt;; the release was heavily delayed, finally appearing on August 1, 2013 -- three months after the intended release date. The team promised to turn the post formats feature into a plugin, but the plugin never materialized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a user-facing feature held up a WordPress release. Because features were tied to the development cycle, it meant that the release cycle&apos;s duration restricted and compromised UI features and/or major architectural changes. Just like tagging before it, post formats was a problem too complex to solve in a few short months. It isn’t always easy to make interface decisions. It’s harder to iterate on design than on code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the release deadline approaches and a feature isn&apos;t ready, the development team rushes to try to get it finished. The release is delayed by a week, and then by another week, and in some extreme cases, as was the case with WordPress 3.6, the release is delayed by months. By that point, it becomes impossible to give a firm date for when a release will happen. And the process becomes more complicated as the release lead oscillates between trying to improve a feature and deciding to pull it. Up until 3.6, there was no contingency plan built into the development process that allowed for these challenges in designing a user-facing UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem was available, and always had been available, within WordPress’ infrastructure. Twice before, core user features had been pulled from plugins into core -- widgets and menus. Widgets had been built for the WordPress.com audience, turned into a plugin, and brought in to core. Menus had stumped the core development team and they solved that problem with a plugin. In both these cases, feature design and testing happened long before approaching core. And as the WordPress 3.6 cycle dragged on, a small group of designers worked on a new WordPress feature in a plugin: it was a project called MP6. The project would be the flagship for a new approach to development that had a lasting influence on how WordPress features were developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;44. MP6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2013, WordPress&apos; admin had seen little change since the Crazyhorse redesign in 2008. Change happened in 2013, though it didn’t only result in a new look for WordPress. WordPress feature development changed, introducing a new approach in which feature design, feedback, and iteration used a plugin that was eventually merged with core. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23333&quot;&gt;Ben Dunkle proposed new, flat icons&lt;/a&gt;. The WordPress admin was outdated, particularly on retina displays where the icons pixelated. Flat icons would scale properly and also allow designers to color icons using CSS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/23369&quot;&gt;Andrew Ozz checked in the changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes kicked off huge discussions about icons, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23415&quot;&gt;a new trac  ticket&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/02/12/discuss-icons/&quot;&gt;long discussion on the UI P2&lt;/a&gt;. People were divided on the icons. Some liked them, but felt that they didn&apos;t fit WordPress&apos; admin design; modern icons only emphasized how dated the rest of the admin had become. Consensus didn&apos;t materialize. Mark, who was release lead at the time, decided not to put the changes in WordPress 3.6. Instead, designers interested in redesigning the admin could iterate on the design in a plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/&quot;&gt;MP6&lt;/a&gt;. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Miklic (MT), the designer who had put the original coat of paint on Crazyhorse, helmed MP6. Via Skype, Matt asked MT and Ben Dunkle to reimagine WordPress&apos; admin, consider how a redesign could work, and set parameters. MT believed that they ought to respect the research that informed Crazyhorse&apos;s UI. Instead of iterating the layout and functionality, they focused on an aesthetic refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Matt and MT were keenly aware of the issues and challenges in each major WordPress admin redesign. They wanted MP6 to be different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shuttle, for example, had been cut off from the rest of the community, designed by a cloistered group of designers trading comps and slowly losing touch with &quot;the client.&quot; No one person was responsible for Shuttle&apos;s overall vision; there was no accountability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Happy Cog team looked at WordPress with a fresh set of eyes. Their distance allowed them to treat WordPress as a piece of software, not as an object of devotion. They stayed in touch with their client -- Matt -- but were removed from the community&apos;s thoughts and opinions. MP6 solicited feedback from all of the people with a stake in the project. That brought its own challenges -- whose feedback was the most legitimate? What should be integrated? When was someone just complaining for the sake of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazyhorse emphasized the importance of in-depth user testing. With all the testing on Crazyhorse, MT knew that he didn&apos;t want to carry out a structural overhaul, conduct extensive tests, and gather the data needed to prove improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MP6 project took a different approach. Like Shuttle, a group of designers worked alongside the free software project. Instead of a mailing list, they had a Skype channel so that they could talk in private, but anyone was allowed to join in. &quot;Even though the group worked in private,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_02_04_Thomas.html#L76&quot;&gt;says MT&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;the door into the group we were working on was open, so if anyone said they were interested they could just walk in.&quot; This allowed people less comfortable with WordPress&apos; chaotic bazaar to participate. Designers traded ideas and feedback -- without the danger of someone coming out of nowhere and tearing an idea down before it was even fully formed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MP6 project took advantage of WordPress’ plugin architecture; work took place on a plugin hosted on the WordPress plugin directory. Anyone could install the plugin and see the changes in their admin. Every week, the group shared a release and a report open to public feedback. This open process meant that community members could be involved on different levels. It also meant that the group could never steer too far off course. The core team was always aware of what was going on with MP6 and could provide feedback. More designers were involved than with Shuttle: the group grew to fifteen members. With MT as lead, they avoided the &quot;too many cooks&quot; problem. The designers and the community accepted that MT had the final say on the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MP6 project was &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/&quot;&gt;announced in March 2013&lt;/a&gt;. The design process began with MT playing around with the CSS. He started out with a unified, black, L-shaped bar around the top and the side of the admin screen: &quot;the idea,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_02_04_Thomas.html#L104&quot;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;was that the black would feel like a background and the white would feel like the sheet of paper lying on top of it, so it would unify these disparate things.&quot; Once MT assembled the basic visual, the contributors refined the design. These changes happened iteratively. The community saw a report and a new plugin release each week, on which they gave feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges arose. &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/11/11/open-sans-bundling-vs-linking/&quot;&gt;Google web fonts&lt;/a&gt; caused heated discussion. Web fonts are designed specifically for the web. They’re often hosted in a font repository. A designer uses a CSS declaration to connect to the repository and the font is delivered to a website or app. MP6 uses the Open Sans font, which means that the font in WordPress&apos; admin screens is hosted on Google&apos;s servers. Whenever a user logs into their admin, Google serves the fonts. Some don&apos;t want to connect to Google from their website; this also causes problems for people in countries where Google is blocked. Bundling the fonts with WordPress, however, requires a huge amount of specialized work to ensure that they work across platforms, browsers, and in different languages. In the end, they decided to use Google web fonts. A plugin was created to allow users to shut them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite minor hitches, the MP6 project went smoothly. Joen Asmussen, who&apos;d been a part of the Shuttle project eight years earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_05_Asmussen.html#L73&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;I would say that MP6 did everything right that Shuttle did wrong.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the eight years since the first attempt to redesign WordPress’ admin, WordPress had matured. When things are done behind closed doors, people feel disenfranchised, and yet the bazaar style model doesn’t suit every, single aspect of software development. It’s within this tension that a balance must be struck, with space for ideas to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MP6 plugin merged with WordPress 3.8, released in December 2013, demonstrating that, while it may take a while to get there, harmonious design in a free software project is possible.
&lt;img alt=&quot;The write screen in the WordPress 3.8 admin&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/45/mp6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Write screen in the WordPress 3.8 admin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this happened as 3.6 rumbled on. Development continued on the core product, MP6 development happened separately; it wasn’t constrained by WordPress&apos; release timeline. MT and the designers iterated quickly; users installed the plugin to test it and offer feedback. This was a new process that hadn&apos;t been possible before. To test new features in the past, a user would have to run trunk. By developing the feature as a plugin, a community member could focus by helping with the sole plugin that they were interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MP6 was proving to be a success, and in the summer of 2013, it was decided, for the first time, to develop two versions of WordPress simultaneously -- 3.7 and 3.8. WordPress 3.7 was a two-month, platform-focused, stability and security release lead by Andrew Nacin and John Cave. New features in 3.8 were developed as a plugin.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/08/07/wordpress-3-8-meeting-thursday-august-8/&quot;&gt;Nacin wrote&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This “features as plugins” method* will allow teams to conceptualize, design, and fully develop features before landing them in core. This removes a lot of the risk of a particular feature introducing uncertainty into a release (see also 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 …) and provides ample room for experimentation, testing, and failure. As we’ve seen with MP6, the autonomy given to a feature team can also allow for more rapid development. And in a way, 3.7 provides a bit of a buffer while we get this new process off the ground.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the project prepared to merge MP6 as a plugin in WordPress 3.8, an opportunity arose to do automatic updates -- something that had been talked of within the project for years. Automatic updates had long been a goal, previously unachievable. Automatic updates needed the proper code structure to be in place on WordPress.org, as well as community trust. Community members needed to be okay with WordPress changing their site automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress has collected data since WordPress 2.3 that allows WordPress.org to create personalized automatic updates. WordPress uses the data to make sure that a site receives an update compatible with its PHP version and site settings. In the few failure cases, the user gets an error message with an email address that they can use to email the core developers who will fix their website. As of late 2014, automatic updates are for point releases only. So while major releases of WordPress are not automatic (3.7, 3.8, etc.) point releases are (3.7.1, 3.8.1, for example). This means that security updates and bug fixes can easily be pushed out to all WordPress users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the space of just two short releases -- 3.7 and 3.8 -- big changes transformed the software and the development process. Automatic updates mean that WordPress users are safer than ever. WordPress 3.8 saw the first release in which a feature developed as a plugin merged with core. This finally decoupled core development from feature development. So many past delays and setbacks happened because a feature held up a release. It gave developers more scope for experimentation and created safe spaces for contributors to get involved with core development. While the MP6 admin redesign was &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/&quot;&gt;the first plugin integrated under this model&lt;/a&gt;, since then, feature-plugins have brought in a widget customizer, a new theme experience, and widget functionality changes. Experiments are ongoing in image editing, front-end editing, user session management, and menus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;30. Riding the Crazyhorse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Ryan Boren, WordPress 2.7 ushered in “the modern era of WordPress.” It also brought a new face to the WordPress project. WordPress 2.5&apos;s redesign wasn&apos;t well received, though the reasons why weren&apos;t clear. Was the user interface the problem? Or did people dislike it because they felt cut out of the process? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen Mylo (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/jenmylo&quot;&gt;jenmylo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Matt are old friends. At the time, she ran a usability testing and design center at a New York agency in conjunction with Ball State University. The center&apos;s usability studies used the latest eye-tracking technologies with clients, including television networks such as ABC, NBC, and MTV. When a TV network missed a usability test window, Jen offered the slot to WordPress at cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usability review had three stages conducted in two rounds. In Round 1, they tested WordPress 2.5, gathering &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; recommendations to improve the admin&apos;s UI. Using the recommendations, the development team created and tested a prototype (Test1515) to learn whether users&apos; experiences had improved. In Round 2, they created and tested a more drastic prototype -- dubbed Crazyhorse &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; -- based on the Test1515 findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team used three main testing methods in Round 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk-aloud, in which participants are asked to think aloud as they carry out tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morae screen activity and video recordings, which allow researchers to watch participants remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eye-tracking technology to identify granular problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/new-york-usability-testing/&quot;&gt;Twelve participants&lt;/a&gt; tested WordPress&apos; admin. In Round 1, despite finding WordPress generally easy-to-use, the researchers identified several problems, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verbs vs. nouns: users found it difficult to conceptualize tasks because they weren&apos;t action-oriented (Write/Manage). Instead, users perceived content in a more object-oriented way. (Posts, Pages, Comments, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users didn&apos;t spend time on the dashboard. They used it as an entry point for other pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The write post screen caused problems for users. Tags and categories appeared below the fold; some participants forgot to add categories and tags before publication -- returning to the post screen to add them afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The comments screen was confusing. Users didn&apos;t understand that they had to click on a commenter&apos;s name to edit a comment; they looked in the wrong place when asked to move a comment to spam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between uploading and embedding media in the media uploader confused users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Round 1 testing on WordPress 2.5 uncovered minor issues with settings, the media library, link categories, and tag management. Users also wanted more control over dashboard modules and the post edit screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to a laundry list of small interface issues that presented simple fixes, such as changing comment author links, we were faced with larger issues such as the desire for user-determined hierarchies on long/scrolling screens, ambiguity in the Write/Manage navigation paradigm, and a disconnect between the act of adding media to a post and the ability to manage it. -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Resources/articles/2008_07_Usability_Report_Crazyhorse.pdf&quot;&gt;Usability Test Report&lt;/a&gt; (PDF)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor changes were incorporated into the Test1515 prototype and tested -- though they were so minor that participants didn&apos;t react strongly either way. The team created Crazyhorse to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maximize vertical space,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce scrolling,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase access to navigation to reduce unnecessary screen loads,&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;enable drag and drop on screens that would most benefit from user control, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;redesign management screens to take advantage of natural gaze paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen and Liz Danzico -- who continued to work on WordPress’ usability in the Crazyhorse project -- created the design for the prototype. They sketched multiple ideas: front-end editing, accordion panes, and a top navigation. They chose the simplest prototype: a left-hand navigation panel, similar to Google Analytics and other web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Crazyhorse dashboard prototype&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/30/crazyhorse-prototype-dashboard.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dashboard in the Crazyhorse prototype.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-June/020652.html&quot;&gt;developers built the Crazyhorse prototype in a Subversion branch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/dropbox/2008/06/wordpress-prototype-1.1.pdf&quot;&gt;based on the prototype document&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), which outlined changes and rationale. The project focused on user experience and functional development, so the prototype retained WordPress 2.5&apos;s visual styles. As in Round 1 testing, participants carried out tasks; talk-aloud, Morae, and eye-tracking helped assess results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most participants preferred Crazyhorse over WordPress 2.5 and every new feature tested provided actionable information for the next version of WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants loved the navigation on the left-hand side of the screen. They also preferred the object-oriented approach to organization. (Posts, Pages, Media, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants thought the Crazyhorse dashboard was more useful, and people appreciated the ability to customize it. They liked QuickPress, though they weren&apos;t sure if they would use it. With action links beneath comments, users found it easier to edit and moderate them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Crazyhorse write screen prototype&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/30/crazyhorse-prototype.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Write Screen in the Crazyhorse prototype.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Write screen had a drag and drop feature -- allowing users to decide which elements got prime screen real estate. They also liked access to post comments; they felt that the new media uploader -- with media library integration -- was a huge improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The bottom publish bar in the crazyhorse prototype&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/30/crazyhorse-prototype-publish.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bottom publish bar in the Crazyhorse prototype.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users panned a publishing bar that floated at the bottom of the screen -- they&apos;d look at the bar a few times before realizing it contained the Publish button. Some users compared it to a banner ad or thought it part of their browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Happy Cog and project Crazyhorse did user research, they ended up with quite different results. For Happy Cog, Liz interviewed community members and conducted in-person user testing. The Crazyhorse project, however, used eye-tracking technology. This meant that the testers didn&apos;t have to rely solely on what participants said; they had insight into what participants were actually looking at during tests. Additionally, gaze trails revealed how users navigated the screen with their eyes, allowing testers to ask: what draws user attention first? Do they miss important UI elements? Do they understand what they&apos;re seeing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Crazyhorse prototypes a proven success, fleshing out its design was the next step. When Crazyhorse &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7552&quot;&gt;first merged with trunk&lt;/a&gt;, it was a set of live wireframes. Design changes had not been introduced to prevent swaying participants by color or typeface preferences. By the time the Automattic meetup in Breckenridge, Colorado, took place in 2008, Crazyhorse was ready for some color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Automattic meetups, small teams work on projects assigned at the beginning of the week. Matt Miklic (MT) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/iammattthomas&quot;&gt;iammattthomas&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; took on Crazyhorse with free design rein. In redesigning the admin, Jen and MT produced many designs. There was a heavy blue variant reminiscent of Shuttle-inspired WordPress, and a version using the light blue, grays, and orange of Happy Cog. Eventually, these two main variants melded into a gray color scheme that WordPress featured until 2013. Andrew Ozz (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/azaozz&quot;&gt;azaozz&lt;/a&gt;) received commit access to help implement the Crazyhorse changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen&apos;s community connection differentiated the Happy Cog and Crazyhorse processes. She kept the community abreast of what was going on. She did testing as an adjunct to the WordPress project to verify actual usability flaws with little community involvement. If it had been just a matter of user color preferences, the Crazyhorse project would have been fruitless. But when testing revealed WordPress&apos; interface needed to change, community dialogue ensued. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/the-visual-design-of-27/&quot;&gt;designs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/usability-testing-report-25-and-crazyhorse/&quot;&gt;usability report&lt;/a&gt; were shared on the development blog. The team surveyed users on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2008/09/wordpress-27-navigation-options-survey/&quot;&gt;navigation options&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-October/021944.html&quot;&gt;the community discussed issues on the wp-hackers mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. When WordPress 2.7 released, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/&quot;&gt;launch post&lt;/a&gt; lists the posts Jen and the developers wrote about the process. Up to that point, it is the only iteration of the WordPress admin to have such an information trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Crazyhorse project, WordPress&apos; admin changed drastically -- twice in 2008 alone. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/09/02/first-look-at-wordpress-27/&quot;&gt;screenshots of the changes appeared on community blogs&lt;/a&gt;, the inevitable question was &quot;why are they changing it again?&quot; WordPress 2.5&apos;s design hadn&apos;t settled in before another huge change came about with the implementation of Crazyhorse in 2.7. A UI change meant that users of varying skill levels needed to relearn how to use WordPress; the growing WordPress tutorial community would need to retake every screenshot and reshoot every video. However, when WordPress users upgraded, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/wordpress-27-available-now/#comments&quot;&gt;feedback was positive&lt;/a&gt;. Users loved the new interface; they found it intuitive and easy to use -- finally demonstrating that it wasn&apos;t change they had been unhappy with just nine months earlier -- but the interface itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The write screen in the WordPress 2.7 admin&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/30/2_7_admin.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Write Screen in the WordPress 2.7 admin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 2.7 brought the WordPress Plugin Repository to the admin screen. Users no longer had to download a plugin and upload it using FTP. They could search the plugin directory for the features they needed right from their admin, and install the plugin with just a few clicks. This made it much easier for WordPress users to quickly find and install plugins, removing FTP&apos;s technical barrier to entry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress’ documentation also improved. In December 2006, Matt posted to wp-hackers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-December/009812.html&quot;&gt;apologizing for his stance on inline documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2474#comment:7&quot;&gt;Inline documentation patches&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=&quot;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2473#comment:3&quot;&gt;committed to core&lt;/a&gt;. In WordPress 2.7, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-docs/2008-October/001769.html&quot;&gt;PHPDocumentor was added&lt;/a&gt;, through a big push by Jacob Santos (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/jacobsantos/&quot;&gt;jacobsantos&lt;/a&gt;) and Jennifer Hodgdon (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/jhodgdon&quot;&gt;jhodgdon&lt;/a&gt;) to get WordPress functions documented in the code. There was also the beginning of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-docs/2009-January/001862.html&quot;&gt;official user handbook&lt;/a&gt;.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the Crazyhorse redesign, Jen joined Automattic to work on WordPress. At that time, there was a close core developer group who led the project working in IRC and in Skype. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-October/021899.html&quot;&gt;October 2008, Jen first appeared on wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;. She brought fresh eyes and a completely new perspective. Her background in user testing and user experience was largely absent in the community until she joined the project. “Having someone with actual formal training in testing and user experience, it was just useful,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_22_Jaquith.html#L71&quot;&gt;says Mark Jaquith&lt;/a&gt;. “It was not just useful then, but it also changed us. Or at least it changed me. Where I started thinking in these ways as well and becoming better at stepping out of my own head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new focus on user testing and user experience meant that the software would work for everyone who wanted to install it -- not just a small set of users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;31. Themes are GPL too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the project transformed, so did the wider economy around WordPress. When Brian Gardner released the Revolution theme under the GPL in late 2008, theme developers watched with curiosity to see how it would influence his business, as it seemed counterintuitive to give a product away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As theme authors watched and waited, commercial theme licensing came to a head. Toward the end of 2008, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090212220653/http://spectacu.la/wordpressorg-pull-200-gpl-themes&quot;&gt;200 themes were pulled from the WordPress theme repository&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081217021620/http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/about&quot;&gt;statement was added to the About page of the Theme Directory that said&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;All themes are subject to review. Themes for sites that support &apos;premium&apos; (non-GPL or compatible) themes will not be approved.&quot; This meant that the Theme Directory no longer allowed free GPL themes that linked back to the site of a premium theme seller, whether the themes they sold were GPL or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium theme developers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090315162659/http://www.jeffro2pt0.com/why-were-200-wordpress-themes-removed&quot;&gt;the wider community&lt;/a&gt; were annoyed. What was the problem with theme authors selling themes? The themes hosted on the Theme Directory were free and complied with the GPL. As so often in the past, people conflated the actions of WordPress.org with Automattic and the company came under fire. Some perceived theme removal as a sign that Automattic didn&apos;t want anyone making money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme sellers were genuinely unhappy. Their themes were pulled without warning. Many theme sellers saw their free theme releases as a way of supporting the free software community, and spent considerable time ensuring that they met the theme repository&apos;s standards. They felt as though a rug had been pulled from underneath them: they&apos;d done their best to comply with WordPress.org standards, but suddenly it wasn’t enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from Matt made the rounds in the community: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thanks for emailing me about the theme directory. The other day I noticed a ton of bad stuff had snuck in like lots of spammy SEO links, themes whose sites said you couldn&apos;t modify them (which is a violation of the GPL), etc. Exactly the sort of stuff the theme directory was meant to avoid.
&lt;p&gt;There were also a few that violated WP community guidelines, like the domain policy. So since Monday we&apos;ve been clearing stuff out en mass. If you&apos;re kosher with the GPL and don&apos;t claim or promote otherwise on your site and your theme was removed, it was probably a mistake. Give us a week to catch up with the bad stuff and then drop a note.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/12/19/2hr-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/&quot;&gt;podcast on Weblog Tools Collection&lt;/a&gt;, Matt discussed his position on the premium theme market (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpsnippets.com/2008/12/transcript-of-wordpress-weeklys-interview-with-matt-mullenweg-december-2008-part-1/&quot;&gt;transcription&lt;/a&gt;). In the interview, he describes how, while updating a friend’s website, he was looking for WordPress themes in the directory. He found themes with SEO links or linked to SEO sites -- behavior that the Theme Directory had been set up to avoid. The WordPress.org team questioned whether they wanted to allow GPL themes that only served as advertisements for non-GPL themes elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Matt discussed the distinction between “premium” and “free” themes, and the importance of correct labeling. When it comes to &quot;premium&quot; themes, Matt argued that the word &quot;proprietary&quot; makes more sense than &quot;premium&quot; or even &quot;commercial.&quot; GPL themes, such as Brian Gardner&apos;s Revolution, could be commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I love what Revolution has done, where they say &apos;Ok, so we still sold the theme, and we still bundle the support and everything like that with it, but it&apos;s also available as GPL.&apos; So they&apos;re able to, within the GPL framework, create a business and respect the underlying license of the community that they are building on top of.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt made it clear that theme developers were free to do what they wanted on their site, but the WordPress project was equally free to do what it wanted on WordPress.org, and that included whether it should or should not promote businesses that sold non-GPL WordPress products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the aim of the theme and plugin repositories is to promote theme and plugin developers. The project doesn’t want to promote theme developers who follow the license to get on WordPress.org, but then violate WordPress&apos; license elsewhere. So, theme sellers who sell non-GPL products outside of WordPress.org aren&apos;t promoted on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview delineated what WordPress.org would and would not support. People got an answer, whether they liked it or not. The storm calmed and cleared the way for 2009, when businesses started to embrace the GPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months following the debate, people wondered how to sustain a business under the GPL. As the first to embrace the license, Brian Gardner advised other premium theme sellers. In April 2009, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090619172730/http://spectacu.la/were-going-100-gpl/&quot;&gt;Spectacu.la&lt;/a&gt;, the theme shop that first posted about themes being removed from the repo, announced that it was going fully GPL. It was followed in June by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ithemes.com/2009/06/11/ithemes-is-going-gpl/&quot;&gt;iThemes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100309084201/http://www.woothemes.com/2009/06/woothemes-gpled&quot;&gt;WooThemes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Matt announced that he had contacted the Software Freedom Law Centre. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/&quot;&gt;provided an opinion on theme licensing&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the WordPress themes supplied contain elements that are derivative of WordPress&apos;s copyrighted code. These themes, being collections of distinct works (images, CSS files, PHP files), need not be GPL-licensed as a whole. Rather, the PHP files are subject to the requirements of the GPL while the images and CSS are not. Third-party developers of such themes may apply restrictive copyrights to these elements if they wish.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress themes are not a separate entity from WordPress itself. As Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/&quot;&gt;wrote later&lt;/a&gt;, “As far as the code is concerned, they form one functional unit. The theme code doesn&apos;t sit &apos;on top of&apos; WordPress. It is within it, in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following that announcement, more theme sellers adopted the GPL license, though not all went 100% GPL (i.e., including CSS, images, and JavaScript). Envato, for example, whose marketplace, ThemeForest, was growing in popularity, opted &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090819130204/http://blog.themeforest.net/site-news/important-change-to-wordpress-license-takes-effect-today-please-read&quot;&gt;for GPL compliance -- with two licenses&lt;/a&gt;, in which the PHP was GPL, but the additional files were proprietary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes that are packaged using this split license follow the GPL. The PHP carries a GPL license and other assets do not. The other elements -- CSS, images, JavaScript, etc. -- usually have some sort of proprietary license. This ensures legal compliance. It aims to protect author rights by removing the freedoms guaranteed by the GPL -- the freedom to use, modify, and distribute modifications. Users are not free to do what they want with a theme licensed in such a way because the CSS and JavaScript are just as important to a theme as the PHP that interacts with WordPress’ internals. But it would be a number of years before this licensing debate would occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;32. Improving Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen Mylo emphasized usability, as well as encouraged more people to contribute to WordPress. Conversations happened on wp-hackers and trac, but it wasn’t always obvious how new people could get involved with the project. Project growth compounded the problem; it wasn’t easy for a new contributor to understand what was going on, nor how to contribute. Jen &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2009/03/contributing-to-wordpress-part-i-development/&quot;&gt;wrote about how to get involved&lt;/a&gt;, and the development blog announced &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2009/04/the-super-awesome-wordpress-24-hour-has-patch-marathon/&quot;&gt;patch marathons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2009/10/upcoming-bug-hunts/&quot;&gt;bug hunts&lt;/a&gt;.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen brought more structure to the project: she reinstated weekly development chats with agendas and prevented discussions from disappearing down rabbit holes. When she joined the project, core developers communicated in two main ways: via the IRC chat room and by private Skype channel. Skype&apos;s drawback is that it&apos;s closed -- it doesn’t create opportunities for other people to get involved. Also, because the main blog at the time, wpdevel.wordpress.com, was on WordPress.com and not WordPress.org, it didn’t feel official. There had been little project management; developers wrote code and pushed it out when it was ready.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time,  Matt stepped back. Ryan Boren led development, while Jen stepped up to project-manage the software and took a leadership role within the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tried to address communication fragmentation within the project. By 2009, project communication happened in different places: trac, wp-hackers, the #wordpress-dev IRC chat room, &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/page/121/&quot;&gt;wpdevel.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;, and the WordPress.org development blog. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2009/05/ideas/&quot;&gt;Jen highlights&lt;/a&gt; the state of each of WordPress’ primary communication channels: the #wordpress-dev channel had become mostly inactive; wp-hackers had thousands of subscribers, but was often just a troubleshooting forum; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/&quot;&gt;development blog&lt;/a&gt; was used for official announcements only; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/&quot;&gt;wpdevel.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; blog (directed now to &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core&quot;&gt;http://make.wordpress.org/core&lt;/a&gt;) housed team progress updates; Trac had become an unworkable mess with hundreds of irrelevant tickets; and the ideas forum contained many highly voted, but irrelevant threads.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication improvements were discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/ideas-forumcommunication-channels?replies=55&quot;&gt;a forum thread&lt;/a&gt;. Suggestions included: a place other than trac for people to raise things; a way to make it easier for people to write automated unit tests, allowing the community to vote on ideas; greater documentation integration for WordPress and trac; adopting P2 for discussion; and using BuddyPress -- a social-networking plugin that is a sister project to WordPress -- on WordPress.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid suggestions were complaints: it was noted that no one official read the ideas forum,  timezone differences made IRC meetups difficult to attend, and too many communication channels existed -- far too many for people to keep up with. Some people complained about community governance and a lack of transparency. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/ideas-forumcommunication-channels/page/2?replies=55#post-1071517&quot;&gt;Jen observed&lt;/a&gt;, “Your post just proves the point that communication is an issue. I would not say that WP lacks a clear direction, I would say that it simply hasn&apos;t been communicated properly.”	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen wanted to clarify how project decisions were made. It wasn’t uncommon for people to toss feature requests into IRC chat. People needed to know what each communication channel was for and understand the correct channels to ask questions and request features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the development discussion had shifted from wp-hackers to trac. Trac&apos;s main benefit is that it focuses discussion directly on the bug, feature, or enhancement at hand. That said, as more and more people started using it, it became -- just like wp-hackers -- susceptible to intractable, bikeshed discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smilies were at the heart of one such recurring discussion. In 2009, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145&quot;&gt;a ticket&lt;/a&gt; requested replacing WordPress’ smilies with Tango/Gnome smilies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11685&quot;&gt;Ryan Boren&lt;/a&gt; committed the patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smilies landed first on WordPress.com, which receives daily codebase updates. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/new-smilies?replies=84&quot;&gt;feedback was negative&lt;/a&gt; and reaction on the trac ticket spiralled; contributors were unhappy that smilies had been changed without discussion. They argued that WordPress had &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145#comment:18&quot;&gt;changed users’ content&lt;/a&gt;, without giving them any say in it. The discussion spread from trac tickets to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/nothing-to-smile-about&quot;&gt;community blogs&lt;/a&gt;. Some wanted a public poll to aid the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Boren eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145#comment:28&quot;&gt;reverted the change&lt;/a&gt;, saying: “Back to the prehistoric smilies that everyone complains about but evidently likes better. :-) I was a fool for not appreciating the explosive topic that is smilies, my bad.” [Fn^1]	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as trying to fix communication problems, some worked on improving documentation. To commit a patch in WordPress core, there is a review process. The WordPress Codex, on the other hand, is the opposite: any contributor can publish documentation immediately. This is a low-friction way to create documentation, but because it lacked rules and structure, it became difficult to navigate; pages fell out of date, and -- despite the efforts of the documentation team -- it became a mess. User documentation is packaged up with developer documentation, often on the same page, and for many WordPress users and developers, the Codex became less useful. In the meantime, WordPress tutorial blogs proliferated. In the absence of good, official documentation, people went elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-docs/2009-August/002034.html&quot;&gt;The Handbook Project sought to create&lt;/a&gt; references for theme and plugin development. The team launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.trac.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;trac instance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wphandbook.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;wordpress.com blog to manage the handbooks&lt;/a&gt;. It can be difficult to recruit long-term help on documentation. With the low-entry barrier, many people make their first WordPress contribution through documentation, but as they figure out the project&apos;s contours they move on to contributing to core. The original handbook project was passed between different people, and by 2014 it was near completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-2009, WordPress dropped the long-term security branch -- something Mark Jaquith had maintained since 2006. The plan was to maintain it until 2010. During that period, however, there were major changes to WordPress’ security. Backporting those changes into the 2.0.x branch meant complex rewriting that could have introduced new bugs or instability. The developers found that few people were on 2.0; new feature proliferation meant that people upgraded more readily. The legacy branch continued until just six months shy of its 2010 target, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/the-wordpress-2-0-x-legacy-branch-is-deprecated/&quot;&gt;was deprecated in July 2009&lt;/a&gt;.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-June/032447.html&quot;&gt;Long-term support branch (LTS) requests remain&lt;/a&gt; -- specifically from big companies that use WordPress as a CMS -- though it’s unlikely that WordPress will ever start a new branch. Matt &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-June/032483.html&quot;&gt;wrote to wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not backporting is a conscious decision. I would rather invest 100 hours in backward compatibility in a new version than 2 hours in backporting a fix to an obsolete version of WordPress. Plus, as noted by everyone else, backporting was often impossible because it wasn&apos;t one or two line fixes, it was architecture changes that would touch dozens of files. The LTS was actually &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; stable with these &quot;fixes&quot; backported because it had almost no one using it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than supporting an LTS branch, the project focuses on easy updates and compelling features that entice users to upgrade. This iterative process has continued to improve throughout the project’s history, from Matt’s first mention of upgrades in his 2006 State of the Word address, to automatic updates introduced in WordPress 3.7. This approach focuses development on keeping users secure, rather than trying to maintain older software branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Fn^1] The smiley debate was reignited in 2014, when WordPress.com updated its emoticons and a proposal was made to &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970&quot;&gt;produce high-dpi smilies for use on retina displays&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, people had strong opinions, as seen across &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-smiley-wars-will-core-adopt-new-emoticons&quot;&gt;community blogs&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2015, the smilies are still not updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;33. Meeting in Person&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2009, the core team -- Matt, Mark, Ryan, Westi, Andrew, and Jen -- met in Orlando, Florida. Despite working together on the project for years, it was the first time that some of them were meeting face to face. Working from the Bohemian Hotel lobby, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/intermission/&quot;&gt;discussed live project issues&lt;/a&gt;, including “the merge, canonical plugins, the WordPress.org site, community stuff, and all the other things that are important but that we never seem to have time to address.” As well as discussing WordPress&apos; vision and goals, they had a trac sprint that edged them closer to shipping WordPress 2.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/33/1st-core-meetup.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right: Mark Jaquith, Jen Mylo, Andrew Ozz, Peter Westwood, Matt Mullenweg, Ryan Boren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/core-team-meetup-results/&quot;&gt;posted results to the WordPress news blog&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the breadth of the discussion: 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Direction for the coming year(s), canonical plugins, social i18n for plugins, plugin salvage (like UDRP for abandoned plugins), WordPress/MU merge, default themes, CMS functionality (custom taxonomies, types, statuses, queries), cross-content taxonomy, media functions and UI, community “levels” based on activity, defining scope of releases, site menu management, communications within the community, lessons learned from past releases, mentorship programs, trac issues, wordpress.org redesign, documentation, community code of conduct.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting in person allowed them to bounce ideas off of one another and to get work done. Jen recalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We sat in these red velvet chairs in the bar of the Bohemian Hotel in Orlando, and when it was time to eat we would go into the dining room and we would eat. And we&apos;d come back and we&apos;d work, and we were on our laptops and actually going through trac as well. And doing bug scrubs, but then we would stop and we would have just conversations and we&apos;d go outside maybe or we&apos;d go out to lunch. And so we kind of mixed it up, and it was just so helpful. Both in terms of just getting to know each other better, and the actual work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetups continue to be part of core development, from small and focused ones with the core team to large gatherings involving the whole community. Members meet at WordCamps, or at dedicated meetups to do code sprints and to discuss the general project and development direction. They provide an opportunity for people to discuss issues without the barrier of a screen, and also to socialize, hang out, and get to know one another better. When community members meet, they generate new ideas and thrash out old ideas in detail. Meetups aren’t, however, without side effects. Meeting in person, by its nature, excludes everyone who isn’t physically present. In a free software project, it&apos;s important to balance offline meetups with online activity, which allows everyone to have a say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canonical plugins project was discussed at the first core meetup. The WordPress plugin repository was growing, and many plugins did the same thing. Large, complex plugins can transform WordPress, though some plugins had poor code quality, while some were out of date. Sometimes, a developer drops a plugin, leaving users without support or updates -- a big problem if a user relies heavily on the feature. The core development team felt that some plugins warranted a similar process to the core development process, where a group of coders lead a plugin&apos;s development, deciding what goes in and what doesn’t, in a similar way to how WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress are developed. Rather than having ten SEO plugins, or ten podcasting plugins, for example, there would be one canonical plugin, sanctioned by core with its own official development team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress’ core development team supported the proposal, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/canonical-plugins/&quot;&gt;Jen wrote about on the blog&lt;/a&gt;; the strong relationship between WordPress core and canonical plugins would ensure plugin code was secure, that they exemplified the highest coding standards, and that they would be tested against new versions of WordPress to ensure compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early discussions focused on what to call this cluster of plugins. The community voted and decided on “Core plugins.” Then, a team got to work, which included Westi, Aaron Campbell (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell&quot;&gt;aaroncampbell&lt;/a&gt;), Austin Matzko (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/filosofo&quot;&gt;filosofo&lt;/a&gt;), Stephen Rider (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/Strider72&quot;&gt;Strider72&lt;/a&gt;), and Pete Mall (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/PeteMall/&quot;&gt;PeteMall&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/&quot;&gt;Health Check&lt;/a&gt;, which checks a website for common configuration errors and known issues; PodPress, a popular podcasting plugin which had been abandoned; and a proposed plugin to shift the post by email functionality from core into a plugin were the first canonical plugins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But plugin developers weren’t so enthusiastic. They liked having ownership over their own plugins. The WordPress project was accused of trying to stifle the growing plugin market. Discussions continued among developers about how core plugins might influence them. Justin Tadlock &lt;a href=&quot;http://onefinejay.com/2010/01/10/shackling-a-free-market-wordpress-canonical-plugins/comment-page-2#comment-7578&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There’s been some great discussion here, but it seems a little one-sided. Most of the people leaving comments are developers. What would make the conversation much better would be to hear from more end users.
&lt;p&gt;I will refrain from sharing my opinion until I can gauge what a larger portion of the user base is feeling because, quite frankly, that’s the portion of the community that influences my opinion the most.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User feedback on the thread was positive: any help sifting through the mass of WordPress plugins was a benefit. Why should users have to sift through fifty contact form plugins when there could be one, officially sanctioned plugin that could serve 80% of users? The project didn&apos;t intend to kill off the plugin market, and Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;http://onefinejay.com/2010/01/10/shackling-a-free-market-wordpress-canonical-plugins/comment-page-2#comment-7589&quot;&gt;tried to calm developer fears&lt;/a&gt;: “Core plugins will be safe and stable,” he wrote, “but limited in scope and probably a little bit boring and not completely full-featured.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core plugins project, however, was beset by other problems. While there was potential for success, they lacked the tools to work effectively across a broad group of plugins. “We didn&apos;t have the toolset at the time to do it properly,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_06_05_Campbell.html#L32&quot;&gt;says Aaron Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, “without stepping outside of the WordPress ecosystem quite a bit and relying on something like a GitHub or something like that, which we prefer not to rely on for things that are really kind of the core of WordPress.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To properly manage core plugins, the WordPress project’s infrastructure would have to change. When the plugin repository was built, it was designed with one author per plugin; developer collaboration tools didn&apos;t exist. (While the plugin repository has become more flexible -- it’s now possible, for example, to have multiple plugin authors -- traditional developer collaboration tools are still lacking.) A system to submit contributions, discuss and modify patches, and merge them are useful for multiple developers working on a single plugin. To develop WordPress, tools have been built around the Subversion repository to make that possible, and the modified trac instance encourages collaboration. But each core plugin would need a replica of the infrastructure that WordPress uses itself, and it became obvious that the plan was untenable.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this, many of the developers were burned out from WordPress 2.9 (and taking a break with the promise of a major release cycle in WordPress 3.0). They didn’t have the time or energy to build core plugins, as well as develop the core product itself. Despite the coverage the project got across the community, and despite the initial burst of energy, the canonical plugins project eventually fizzled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;34. Update Notifications Pt 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community blogs became important gathering spaces for those who wanted to communicate outside the core project&apos;s official channels. One of these was WP Candy, a blog started by Michael Cromarty and later taken over by Ryan Imel. Another was WP Tavern, run by Jeff Chandler. WP Candy and WP Tavern became places where the community could share and discuss ideas, as well as vent outside the project&apos;s central channels -- and over time, both have hosted many major community debates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest debates was around data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When WordPress 2.3 shipped with update notifications, the initial debate quieted down. Lynne Pope (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/Elpie&quot;&gt;Elpie&lt;/a&gt;) reopened the discussion in 2009 on WP Tavern&apos;s forums, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-December/029083.html&quot;&gt;also posted to wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;. Lynne pointed out that Matt had said data collection would be reviewed in WordPress 2.5. She discussed URL collection and asked whether WordPress had a need to collect them, suggesting that an anonymous identifier could replace the blog URL. In the discussion thread on WP Tavern, Lynne went further into her concerns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;wordpress.org is not a legal entity so there is nobody to sue if data is misused. You can&apos;t sue a community. There is no disclosure about what data is collected or how it will be used. People are just supposed to trust that volunteers working on an open source project can be relied upon to keep personal data private?	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2007/03/upgrade-212/&quot;&gt;referenced WordPress.org being cracked in March 2007&lt;/a&gt;; if someone were to crack WordPress.org again, they would have access to all the data.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since much of the data is freely available on the internet, many were unconcerned about the collection, but Lynne pointed out that what isn’t readily available is the totality of that information (WordPress version, PHP version, locale setting, plugin information, and the website’s URL as a package). In 2009, people were growing more concerned about internet privacy. People signed up for social media services that collected huge amounts of data, used to target advertising. A 2009 paper reported that personally identifiable information could be &lt;a href=&quot;http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2009/workshops/wosn/papers/p7.pdf&quot;&gt;leaked from social networks&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) and third parties could link that data with actions on other websites. At the same time, internet users were becoming more vocal about privacy concerns. In February 2009, for example, when Facebook changed its Terms of Service to say that user data would be retained by Facebook even if the user quit the service, the company faced an outcry and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/update-on-terms/54746167130&quot;&gt;forced to backtrack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of these privacy concerns, WordPress was a bastion of the independent web. If a person has privacy concerns, they can avoid using social media; but they can create a website using something like WordPress, on their own server, with complete control over their own data. For some people in the community, data collection tarnishes this independence. There is potential for abuse, and even if there is trust in the people who have access to this data now, there’s no guarantee that others with access to the data will use it in the same way in the future.

Mark Jaquith, who had originally opposed the data collection, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-December/029089.html&quot;&gt;responded to Lynne on wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The more I thought about it, the more my knee-jerk objections faded away. Your server is doing an HTTP request, so the server knows your server&apos;s IP address. You can figure out what blog domains are hosted on that IP with a search on Bing or several other search engines. So if WordPress.org really wanted to know your URL, it could find it. Again, that&apos;s just based on the IP address, which you HAVE to send for HTTP to work. If your URL is discoverable, and your IP address has to be sent, withholding the URL doesn&apos;t actually get you more privacy, ultimately.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wp-hackers saw some of this discussion, it mostly took place on WP Tavern. The discussion thread generated 291 responses -- the most popular post in the forum&apos;s lifespan. It was also &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/12/10/is-wordpress-spyware/&quot;&gt;heavily discussed on Weblog Tools Collection&lt;/a&gt; under a post from Jeff Chandler, titled “Is WordPress spyware?”	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue was &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5066#comment:23&quot;&gt;reopened on WordPress trac&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2009/12/10/suggest-agenda-items-for-dec-17th-dev-ch/#comment-1030&quot;&gt;was proposed for the development chat agenda&lt;/a&gt;. Some community members felt that their privacy concerns were valid, and that they weren’t being taken seriously. In the thread, Matt posts that WordPress.org only stores the latest update sent, but no historical data. Historical data is only held in aggregate so that statistics can be provided for plugin and theme developers.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark joined the discussion on WP Tavern to share some of the reasons he changed his mind:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An IP address, which must be sent by the server, is not significantly more anonymous than a URL.&lt;/li&gt;	
&lt;li&gt;URLs allow WordPress to verify the identity of a blog. When URLs are hashed it’s no longer possibly to verify the blog identity. Without proper verification, systems that involve plugin rankings based on usage or popularity are open to manipulation and abuse.&lt;/li&gt;	
&lt;li&gt;The privacy policy was updated to cover api.wordpress.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;	
&lt;p&gt;The core developers stuck with their &lt;em&gt;decisions, not options&lt;/em&gt; philosophy; no option was added to turn off update notifications. By the time it was raised again, in 2009, the project could apply another one of its philosophies to making the decision -- the 80% principle: if 80% of users find something useful, then it belongs in core; if not, then it belongs in a plugin. A number of plugins were created to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=core+update+notification&quot;&gt;disable update notifications&lt;/a&gt;, but only a fraction of people used them. A clear notification of a website or plugin update was more important than adding a preference to satisfy a small number of people within the WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress continues to collect data about sites, which is used in a number of ways. The project, for instance, can make informed decisions about which technologies to support. Using the data, it was possible to tell that, in 2010, around 11% of WordPress users were using a PHP version below 5.2, and that fewer than 6% of WordPress users were using MySQL 4.0. Using that information, the development team was confident about &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/&quot;&gt;dropping support for PHP 4.0 and MySQL 4.0&lt;/a&gt;. Browser usage data also helped in the decision to deprecate support for Internet Explorer 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is helpful when there is a security issue with a plugin, too. The project can detect how many sites have a plugin active and can determine the severity of the issue. In the case of a security issue in a popular plugin, web hosts are informed so that sites with insecure versions of a plugin can be blocked at the host level. Update notifications were also an important stage in the road toward automatic updates for minor releases, which were introduced in WordPress 3.7.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;35. The WordPress Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this time, Automattic held WordPress&apos; trademarks. Trademarks are an important asset to companies, to free software projects, and to anyone who has a product to protect. A trademark represents a project’s reputation, and is a symbol of official endorsement. Free software licenses protect the terms under which a program can be distributed, but they don’t grant trademark rights. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/view/11/37&quot;&gt;2009 article on trademarks in open source projects, Tiki Dare and Harvey Anderson&lt;/a&gt; report that of the 65 licenses endorsed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.org/licenses&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative (OSI)&lt;/a&gt;, 19 don’t mention trademarks, 19 prohibit trademarks in publicity, advertising, and endorsements, and a further 26 explicitly exclude trademark rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark law protects a piece of code&apos;s marks and branding -- not the code itself. A software project’s code exists in its community&apos;s commons, but the trademarks do not. The growing issue of free software trademarks was conceded in 2007 with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html&quot;&gt;GPLv3&lt;/a&gt;. One clause states that the license may be supplemented with terms “declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks.” This reflects that free software communities accept that a trademark is not necessarily linked to the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users and consumers associate a trademark with the original project; the trademark denotes trust, quality, and dependability. It also helps to verify identity: if you’re dealing with a company bearing the Widget Company logo, then you expect to be dealing with Widget Company. This matters in the free software community as much as in the corporate world. A free software project&apos;s trademark carries certain assumptions: that the project maintainers and developers are either involved with or officially endorse that product or service, and that it meets quality standards. “Being the source of code arguably matters more than source code in an open-source business,” write Dare and Anderson. “The code is easily replicated, as it is open, but the trust associated with source (or origin) is not replicable. Trademarks are all about source.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automattic registered the WordPress trademarks in 2006, but some contributors -- who had helped build the software or started their own local communities -- felt that they had as much right to the trademarks as Automattic. Some community members believed that the community owned the codebase and thus should own the trademarks, not the corporate entity. What Automattic did have, and the community at large didn’t, was the structure and money to protect the trademarks from abuse and dilution. This often came at the cost of good relations with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automattic had always intended to place the trademarks with the WordPress Foundation, which is a separate entity from the company. Automattic acted as a short-term trademark guardian, protecting the trademarks until another body could take over. This was made clear to the company’s investors at the outset. Phil Black, one of Automattic&apos;s first investors, recalls knowing that the trademarks would not remain with the company. “It wasn’t like Matt was proposing something to us where we felt like a significant asset was being lost,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_15_Black.html#L49&quot;&gt;says Phil&lt;/a&gt;. “A significant asset was being transferred to the right third party as we thought that it should have been.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation counterbalances Automattic, providing checks and balances should Automattic ever be acquired. “Let’s say Evil Co. ran Automattic,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_17_Mullenweg.html#L355&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;, “and Evil Co. only cares about making money. The balance between WordPress.org and the WordPress Foundation and WordPress.com is such that I think even Evil Co. would do the right thing with regard to the community and the code and everything.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation took longer to set up than expected; various factors needed to be in place before it launched. Before the trademarks could be transferred, they needed to be properly secured and protected. Toni Schneider managed this during his early days at Automattic. It also took a long time to register the non-profit with the IRS. Because non-profits are tax-exempt, it can be difficult to set one up. Matt wanted the Foundation to hold the trademarks, but simply holding trademarks is not considered a legitimate non-profit activity. Applications sent to the IRS were denied for several years. In the end, the WordPress Foundation received 501(c)(3) status as an organization charged with educating people about WordPress and related free software projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation’s website&lt;/a&gt; states its mission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of the foundation is to ensure free access, in perpetuity, to the software projects we support. People and businesses may come and go, so it is important to ensure that the source code for these projects will survive beyond the current contributor base, that we may create a stable platform for web publishing for generations to come. As part of this mission, the Foundation will be responsible for protecting the WordPress, WordCamp, and related trademarks. A 501(c)3 non-profit organization, the WordPress Foundation will also pursue a charter to educate the public about WordPress and related open source software.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Foundation was launched in January 2010. Automattic transferred &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2010/09/wordpress-trademark/&quot;&gt;the trademarks&lt;/a&gt; later that year in September. As part of the transfer, Automattic was granted use of WordPress for WordPress.com, but not for any future domains. Matt was granted a license for WordPress.org and WordPress.net. As well as transferring the trademarks for WordPress itself, the company also transferred the WordCamp name. As with WordPress itself, this protects WordCamps as non-profit, educational events in perpetuity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2010/09/wordpress-trademark/#comments&quot;&gt;community was pleased&lt;/a&gt; with decoupling WordPress the project from Automattic the company. It gave people more confidence that Automattic was not out to dominate the WordPress commercial ecosystem. Despite some initial confusion about how people were allowed to use the WordPress trademark, eventually it settled down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same year, both Matt and Automattic explored different ways to support the WordPress project. Matt set up another company, Audrey Capital, which is the home for his investments. Audrey Capital allows him to hire developers for tasks that he doesn’t have time for, and this separation offers some balance between people who contribute to WordPress and who aren’t employed at Automattic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea was to kind of have five people at Automattic working on WordPress core, five people at Audrey working on WordPress core, and then I’ll try to get the different web hosts to each hire a person or two each, and so there’ll be between the three, fifteen-ish people, full-time on WordPress.org,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_17_Mullenweg.html#L379&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Samuel Wood (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42&quot;&gt;Otto42&lt;/a&gt;) was Audrey Capital’s first employee. Matt and Otto share a love for barbecue. Otto was looking for someone to sponsor a BBQ team at the international barbecue festival in Memphis, Tennessee. Knowing Matt liked barbecue, Otto asked him to sponsor the team. Matt said yes and went to Memphis for the festival. The following year, Matt sponsored the group again, and eventually asked Otto to work for him at Audrey. Andrew Nacin -- who would go on to become a lead developer of WordPress -- joined Otto, and since then, Audrey has hired three more people to work on the WordPress project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, changes at Automattic would have an ongoing influence on the project. By August 2010, the company had more than sixty employees. The sheer number of people meant that the completely flat structure was becoming harder to manage. The company moved to a team structure in which groups of people worked on different projects: themes, VaultPress, and support, for example. One of the newest teams at Automattic was the Dot Org Team, dedicated to working on the free software project. Ongoing members were Ryan Boren and Andrew Ozz, WordPress lead developers; Jen Mylo, formerly WordPress&apos; UX lead responsible for the Crazyhorse redesign; and Andrea Middleton, who managed WordCamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams are fairly fluid inside Automattic, and people come to the Dot Org Team to work on the WordPress project, often bringing with them the knowledge and skills that they&apos;ve developed elsewhere in the company. Employees can also do a &quot;Dot Org rotation,&quot; which means that they work on the WordPress project for a release cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dot Org Team has helped mitigate the effects of hiring from the community. Seven out of the first ten Automattic employees came from the WordPress community, and over the years, the company has hired a number of contributors. While this has been good for individuals and for Automattic, it hasn&apos;t always had a positive effect. When WordPress.com was almost the sole focus, contributors worked on the core project, which benefitted both the project and Automattic. Some early contributors who became Automattic employees found themselves spending less and less time on the project. Mark Riley, who was employed to do support, found that he had no time to help out in the WordPress.org support forums. For other people, this has happened slowly, over time, as Automattic has expanded into other products, while the core project evolved in a different direction -- one with governance and structures, wildly different from the days of throwing up patches, heated discussions on wp-hackers, and waiting for Matt or Ryan to commit code.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dot Org Team has formed a bridge between the company and the community, ensuring that there are people within Automattic whose attention is 100% on growing the WordPress product and project. In 2014, the number of people working on WordPress from Automattic expanded even further. The Dot Org Team split into two: a developer team that works on the core software and on WordPress.org (Team Apollo), and a community team that is focused on events and the community (Team Tardis). 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;36. WordPress 3.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 3.0 arrived in 2010, bringing change not only to the software, but to the development process and project structure. Commit access was opened up and all these changes shaped how the project works today. WordPress’ philosophy -- &lt;em&gt;deadlines are not arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; -- was seriously challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2010, Dion Hulse (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/dd32&quot;&gt;dd32&lt;/a&gt;) received commit access during the 3.0 release cycle. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/01/12/dd32-whatcha-gonna-do/&quot;&gt;post announcing Dion’s access&lt;/a&gt;, Matt outlines a new goal for the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the goals for the team in 2010 is to greatly expand the number of people with direct commit access, so the emphasis is more on review and collaboration. Right now commit access is tied up with being a “lead developer,” of which we’ve always found a small group of 3-5 works best, but now we want commit to be more a recognition of trust, quality, and most importantly activity, and something that can dynamically flow in and out as their level of commitment (har har) changes and decoupled from the “lead dev” role.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new approach and decoupling commit access from the lead developer role signaled a big change when every patch went through either Matt or Ryan. There was a need to extend trust to contributors, without necessarily giving them leadership roles within the project. While there were no formal rules, several contributors received commit access: Ron Rennick (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpmuguru&quot;&gt;wpmuguru&lt;/a&gt;), focused on multisite, Dion focused on HTTP, and Daryl Koopersmith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/koop&quot;&gt;koop&lt;/a&gt;) worked on front-end development, while Andrew Nacin (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/nacin&quot;&gt;nacin&lt;/a&gt;) was the codebase generalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as a symbol of trust, extended commit access meant that tickets and bottlenecks were cleared quickly. When lead developers got distracted by life and work, Ryan Boren carried the load. New committers reviewed and committed tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 13, 2010 was WordPress 3.0&apos;s release date. Similar to prior releases -- despite having a deadline -- development focused on scope and headline features, rather than meeting the date. Three main features were defined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&amp;amp;day=2010-01-07#m51679&quot;&gt;scope  chat&lt;/a&gt;: merging WordPress MU with WordPress, menus, and a new default theme to replace Kubrick. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merging WordPress MU with WordPress came for several reasons: WordPress MU was difficult to maintain, 95% of the code was the same as the main WordPress codebase, and Donncha had to manually merge new features post-release. Because WordPress MU hadn&apos;t gained attention from plugin developers, it felt separate from the main WordPress project. To give users a clean upgrade path, WordPress MU merged with WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Rennick, a longtime MU user, assisted with the merge. He and Andrea, his wife, had used WordPress MU for years for their homeschooling blogging network. His script turned a WordPress install into a WordPress MU install. He reverse engineered his script to bring MU functionality into WordPress, ensuring a way to convert a single WordPress install to a Multisite install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron ran a diff &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; against the WordPress MU code, looked for differences in the codebase, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11644&quot;&gt;merged them into WordPress core&lt;/a&gt;. Ryan Boren and Andrew Nacin cleaned up the code. Ron also merged features absent from WordPress MU in plugins, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/&quot;&gt;domain mapping&lt;/a&gt; -- a feature originally developed by Donncha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan A was to allow users to upgrade to WordPress Multisite with one click. “The reason we decided not to do that,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_05_Rennick_R.html#L76&quot;&gt;says Ron&lt;/a&gt;, “is that a lot of the shared hosts would not have been happy if their users could just take any WordPress install, click a button -- without actually knowing anything about what was going to happen -- and convert it over to Multisite. The decision was made to actually make it a physical process that they had to go through.” To change a WordPress installation into Multisite, WordPress users have to edit &lt;code&gt;wp-config&lt;/code&gt;. They need basic technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminology was one of the biggest headaches surrounding the merge. In WordPress 3.0, the project decided to move away from the word “blog,” and instead refer to a WordPress installation as a “site.”  More and more people were using WordPress as a CMS, so the “site” label felt more appropriate. However, in WordPress MU, the parent -- example.org -- is a site, while the subdomain blog.example.org is a blog. With WordPress MU and WordPress merging, which one was the site? An individual WordPress install, or a WordPress install that hosted many blogs? WordPress MU became WordPress Multisite, but that wasn’t the end of it.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters further, WordPress MU had a function &lt;code&gt;get&lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt;option&lt;/code&gt;, which gets options for the entire network, and &lt;code&gt;get&lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt;option&lt;/code&gt; which gets options for individual sites. The functions, therefore, don’t relate entirely to the user interface. That was just one of the functions that caused problems, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nacin.com/2010/03/25/terminology-nightmare-blogs-sites-networks/&quot;&gt;as Andrew Nacin noted&lt;/a&gt;.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom post types and custom taxonomies were two big changes in WordPress 3.0. The default content types in WordPress are posts, pages, attachments, revisions, and nav menus (from WordPress 3.0), and the default taxonomies are categories and tags. In WordPress 3.0, custom post types and taxonomies were given a user interface. So instead of being restricted to just posts and pages, developers could create themes and plugins that had completely new types of content for users, such as testimonials for a business site or books for a book review website. This opened up totally new avenues for theme and plugin developers, and those building custom sites for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menus were the big user-facing feature for WordPress 3.0. At the time, it wasn’t easy for people to add navigation menus to their websites. Menu plugins were popular, so much so that it was obvious that the feature met the 80/20 rule. (Would 80% of WordPress users take advantage of the feature? If yes, put it in core, if not, keep it in a plugin.) The &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11817&quot;&gt;menus ticket was opened in January 2010&lt;/a&gt;. The first approach was to create a menus interface similar to the widgets interface. By mid-February, however, little progress had been made. Proposals competed on how menus should work. Ryan and Jen contacted WooThemes to discuss bringing their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woothemes.com/2010/01/the-awesome-custom-woo-navigation/&quot;&gt;custom woo navigation&lt;/a&gt; into WordPress core. This was just days before the planned feature freeze on February 15, 2010. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WooThemes’ custom navigation made it easy for users to add menus to their websites. Developer Jeffrey Pearce (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/jeffikus&quot;&gt;Jeffikus&lt;/a&gt;) worked with Ptah Dunbar (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/ptahdunbar&quot;&gt;ptahdunbar&lt;/a&gt;) on the core team to modify WooThemes&apos; code for core, and to prepare core for the feature. At the time, core updated jQuery to match the version WooThemes&apos; theme framework used. The original WooThemes codebase created new database tables for the menus. As a general rule, WordPress avoids adding tables to the MySQL database. Instead, core developers used custom post types -- existing core functionality.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Jeffrey found  the time difference challenging. Jeffrey is based in South Africa; core development work happens mostly on US time zones. Development chats took place at 20:30 UTC, which was 22:30 in South Africa. Additionally, Ptah and Jeffrey kept missing each other on Skype.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An environment in which everyone had a voice and an opinion wasn’t something that WooThemes was used to in their development process. Adii Pienaar, co-founder of WooThemes, described the process as excruciating. One of the main points of contention was that WooThemes had originally put the menus in the center of the screen with boxes to add menu items on the right-hand side. WooThemes had invested time into designing it that way, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/02/25/menus-ux-manifesto/&quot;&gt;menu interface was flipped around&lt;/a&gt; to match WordPress’ left to right interface convention.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The menu integration was one of the first times that the project had worked directly with a commercial business (other than Automattic). While the process was not always completely smooth, both sides benefitted from collaborating. WordPress got its menu system. While not exactly the same as the menu system that WooThemes created, it accelerated development. WooThemes got the satisfaction of seeing its code used by every WordPress user. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/woothemes-has-and-will-continue-to-get-credit&quot;&gt;Not everyone felt that WooThemes received adequate credit&lt;/a&gt;, though Jeff didn&apos;t share this viewpoint. “Just to have our name on the contributors&apos; wall -- that to me was good enough,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_06_06_Pearce.html#L47&quot;&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s nice just to be able to say, I built a part of WordPress. No one can ever take that away from me. That was recognition enough for me.”	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 3.0 ended up being a huge release, and while menu discussion continued, launch was delayed again and again. By April, the core team was still sending around wireframes -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&amp;amp;day=2010-04-15&amp;amp;sort=asc#m109848&quot;&gt;discussing whether menus should be pulled from 3.0&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/version-3-0-project-schedule/&quot;&gt;release candidate kept being pushed back&lt;/a&gt;. Matt &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/04/20/deadlines-are-not-arbritrary-theyre-a/&quot;&gt;reiterated one of WordPress’ key philosophies&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Deadlines are not arbitrary, they’re a promise we make to ourselves and our users that helps us rein in the endless possibilities of things that could be a part of every release.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature-led releases meant delays. Menus caused the hold-up with WordPress 3.0, with prevarication over the user interface and implementation. The final release was packed full of features that included the new menus, the WordPress Multisite merge, custom post type and taxonomy UI, custom backgrounds and headers, and an admin color scheme refresh. Any of these features could have been pushed to the next release, but there was no willingness to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more controversial changes in WordPress 3.0 was &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/14996&quot;&gt;a new function&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;code&gt;capital&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;dangit&lt;/code&gt;.  This function ensures that the letter &quot;p&quot; in WordPress is capitalized. People felt that &lt;a href=&quot;http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit&quot;&gt;WordPress was messing with their content&lt;/a&gt; -- that this automatic correction was the start of a slippery slope. For some, it was overbearing pedantry, for others, censorship. WordPress has no business changing what people wrote. Some saw it as incommensurate with the project&apos;s core freedoms: &lt;a href=&quot;http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit&quot;&gt;openness, freedom, and community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the filter broke URLs in some instances. This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13583&quot;&gt;reported before WordPress 3.0’s release&lt;/a&gt;, but because the filter had already worked well on WordPress.com, it wasn’t fixed immediately. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13971&quot;&gt;a user reported&lt;/a&gt; that his image, named “WordpressLogo&lt;em&gt;blue-m.png” was broken because it had been renamed to “WordPressLogo&lt;/em&gt;blue-m.png.” Upon upgrading to WordPress 3.0, other users -- those with folders with the lowercase &quot;p&quot; -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/images-not-appearing-3?replies=30#post-1559585&quot;&gt;had the same problem&lt;/a&gt;. As well as folders, URLs with the lowercase &quot;p&quot; were broken. Hosts saw an uptick in support requests. &quot;When 3.0 arrived,” says Mike Schroder (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/dh-shredder&quot;&gt;dh-shredder&lt;/a&gt;) of Dreamhost, “we had a deluge of support with broken URLs due to &lt;code&gt;capital&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;dangit()&lt;/code&gt; applying to all content. This was a particular problem because it was popular among customers to use &lt;code&gt;/wordpress&lt;/code&gt; as a subdirectory for their install. We helped customers with temporary workarounds in the meantime, but were very happy to see the issue fixed in 3.0.1.&quot; Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13971#comment:15&quot;&gt;added a fix&lt;/a&gt;, but many contributors believed WordPress should never have broken users’ websites in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;capital&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;dangit&lt;/code&gt; function isn’t the only WordPress function that filters content. Other filters include emoticons, autop, shortcodes, texturize, special characters, curly quotes, tag balancing, filtered HTML / kses, and comment link nofollows. From the core developers&apos; perspective, capitalizing the &quot;p&quot; in WordPress didn’t actually change the meaning of the sentence, except in edge cases such as, “Wordpress is the incorrect capitalization of WordPress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit#comment-211354&quot;&gt;Core developers became frustrated&lt;/a&gt; by the hyperbole around the filter and the time spent arguing about it. In a comment on Justin Tadlock’s blog, Mark Jaquith said:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Calling corrections censorship is absurd. It is no less absurd when the capitalization of a single letter is called censorship. There is actual censorship going on all around the world at this very moment. I’m damn proud of the fact that WordPress is being used to publish content that makes governments around the world afraid of the citizens who publish it. I’m incredulous that people are making a fuss about a single character (which is only one of dozens of automatic corrections that WordPress makes). It’s free software that is easily extended (or crippled) by plugins. If the thought of going the rest of your life without misspelling WordPress it too much to bear, you have an easy out. Take it, take a deep breath, and try to pick your battles.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://capitalp.org/&quot;&gt;website Mark created&lt;/a&gt; reflects the position of many of the core developers on the &lt;code&gt;capital&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;dangit&lt;/code&gt; discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/36/capital_p_dangit.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this had all of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-July/032919.html&quot;&gt;hallmarks of a bikeshed&lt;/a&gt;, there were some procedural issues that community members felt ought to be taken seriously. Whether the WordPress software capitalized the &quot;p&quot; in WordPress or not, the method by which the function was added to core broke accepted procedure: no ticket was opened, no patch uploaded to trac. The code was simply committed. For some, this set up an “us vs. them” mentality, where some core developers could commit code as they saw fit, while everyone else in the community was subject to a different process.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these development snafus, with WordPress 3.0, the platform matured, making “WordPress as a CMS” a reality. It also introduced a new default theme for WordPress, ushering in a new approach with new annual default themes. Gone was Kubrick, with its bold, blue header. The new theme, Twenty Ten, showcased WordPress’ new menus feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 3.0 ushered in changes to the project and the development process. It opened up WordPress to a new generation of people who became increasingly active. Over the coming releases, some of those committers would take on leadership, both in terms of development and in the wider community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;37. The WordCamp Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time WordPress 3.0 came out in 2010, 107 WordCamps had been held across the world, in countries as diverse as Thailand, Germany, the Philippines, Canada, Israel, and Chile. WordCamps create spaces in which WordPress users, developers, and designers converge to listen to presentations and talk about WordPress. Participants meet project leaders, socialize, and get to know one another. WordCamps attract new contributors, and developers meet with users to learn about problems they experience with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamps have always been informal, and through the early events, the organization was just as informal as the events themselves. In the beginning, interested community members simply decided to organize a WordCamp. They contacted Automattic for stickers, buttons, and other swag. A blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcamphowto.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/hello-welcome-to-this-super-blog/&quot;&gt;for WordCamp organizers&lt;/a&gt; was set up in 2009, so that organizers could communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2010, Jen took over as &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcamphowto.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/fyi-im-taking-over-as-central-liaison/&quot;&gt;central WordCamp liaison&lt;/a&gt;, instituting changes in WordCamp organization. Jen said that “WordCamps are meant to promote the philosophies behind WordPress itself.” Without any real structure and oversight, things happened contrary to WordPress&apos; core philosophies. For example, WordCamps accepted sponsorship from people and companies in violation of WordPress’ license -- the GPL. While non-GPL compliant developers and companies are welcome to attend WordCamps, they’re not able to organize, sponsor, speak, or volunteer. This is because WordCamps are official platforms of the WordPress project, and the project doesn’t want to endorse or publicize products contrary to its own ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without central oversight, issues arose at WordCamps. Many WordCamps ran without budgets. Some organizers took money for themselves. One WordCamp accepted sponsorship money, the WordCamp folded, and the sponsorship never returned. Another opened for registration just so that the organizer could compile a mailing list to which they could send marketing emails. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamps needed better oversight, including clear guidelines. From May 2010 onward, that started to happen. Jen published &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100723003529/http://central.wordcamp.org/about/&quot;&gt;the first set of WordCamp guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamps should be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;about WordPress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open to all, easy to access, and shared with the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locally organized and focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open to lots of volunteers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stand-alone events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;promote WordPress’ philosophy.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;not be about making money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;	
&lt;p&gt;In some quarters, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onefinejay.com/2010/05/19/a-few-questions-on-jane-wells-revised-wordcamp-policies&quot;&gt;the changes went down badly&lt;/a&gt;. Others &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2010/05/19/wordcamps-need-to-be-gpl-too-now/&quot;&gt;were more relaxed about the changes&lt;/a&gt;, but they, too, asked why people who promoted non-GPL products would be banned from speaking. While many WordPress theme shops were 100% GPL, those that weren&apos;t 100% GPL were indignant that they would have to be GPL-compliant just to speak at a WordCamp.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were frustrations about the way in which the guidelines emerged. They were published without consultation with WordCamp organizers and appeared to be an edict from above. Brad Williams (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/williamsba1&quot;&gt;williamsba1&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_11_10_Williams.html#L45&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;: “I think it probably would have been more beneficial across the board for some more open conversations between the Foundation and the organizers to make sure, one, that these guidelines make sense and that we&apos;re all on the same page and if there was any concerns get those out in the open.&quot; As with previous decisions, the guidelines weren’t part of a conversation between the Foundation and the WordCamp community. When they appeared, they seemed unilateral and the rationale was poorly communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some guidelines responded to community problems. It is important that WordCamps focus on the software. At least 80% of the content should be about WordPress. Presentations about social media, SEO, and broader technology issues should not be the event&apos;s main focus. Other guidelines were more about ensuring that events about WordPress mirror the project&apos;s organization and ethos. Like the project, WordCamps ought to be volunteer-driven, from the organizers, to the speakers, to the volunteers who help out during the day. The WordPress project was built by volunteers and WordPress events run on volunteer power. WordCamps should also be accessible to anyone who chooses to attend. This means keeping ticket prices intentionally low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://plan.wordcamp.org/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/&quot;&gt;guidelines have evolved over the years&lt;/a&gt;, with community feedback. While not everyone is happy with them, WordCamps continue to flourish around the world.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;38. Dealing with a Growing Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time WordPress 3.0 launched, more people were interested in WordPress than ever before. In the early days the project attracted developers, bloggers, and people interested in helping others via support or writing documentation. But several factors meant that people with diverse backgrounds were getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 2.7 demonstrated that making software isn&apos;t just about writing code; design, user experience, UI expertise, and testing are all very much part of the process. Useful software requires a diverse set of eyes. This means attracting new contributors by illuminating the different ways one can contribute to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While development, documentation, and support are obvious ways to participate, in 2009, Jen Mylo wrote about the different ways for people to contribute to the project. One was &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2009/04/contributing-to-wordpress-part-ii-graphic-design/&quot;&gt;graphic design&lt;/a&gt;. After a 2008 icon contest was successful, the project tried to find more ways for designers to contribute. A new trac component for graphic design tasks ensued, and designers were invited to iterate WordPress&apos; visual design. People were also encouraged to participate with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2009/05/testing-opps/&quot;&gt;usability testing&lt;/a&gt;. WordPress 2.7&apos;s success stemmed from user testing during the development cycle. The development team was keen to replicate this process in future releases. Jen also invited people to contribute by sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2009/05/ideas/&quot;&gt;ideas, feedback, and opinions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as her work on the development blog, Jen and other project leaders spoke at WordCamps to encourage community involvement. Developing a strong community was becoming as important as software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project infrastructure changes also affected WordPress’ growth, particularly in the third-party developer community. Users could readily find themes and plugins. Plugins iterated more quickly; the plugin directory launched in March 2007 in WordPress 2.3. Later that year, the plugin update notification system arrived, and from WordPress 2.7 onward, users could install plugins from their admin screens. Theme improvements were similar, if a little later. The theme directory launched in July 2008; it arrived on admin screens with WordPress 2.8 in 2009. Giving users more access to plugins and themes meant third-party developers had much greater access to users than ever. The theme and plugin directory were growing exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme directory was becoming more difficult to manage with the exponential theme growth. Joseph Scott (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/josephscott&quot;&gt;josephscott&lt;/a&gt;) developed the first version of the theme directory, and spent much of his time reviewing themes and providing feedback. While many theme issues were security-related, Joseph also advocated for best practices. Soon the work became too much for one person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2010/06/expanding-the-theme-review-experiment/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The theme directory has been chugging along for more than a year now. During that time we’ve tinkered with the review process and some of the management tools, but haven’t really opened it up as much as we’d like. It’s time to rip off the band-aid and take some action; to that end, we’re looking for community members to help with the process of reviewing themes for the directory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one knew how the experiment would turn out. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/theme-reviewers/2010-June/&quot;&gt;rush of people signed up for the new mailing list&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Theme_Review&amp;amp;oldid=91889&quot;&gt;guidelines were drawn up&lt;/a&gt;. Though the overall response was positive, some felt that the guidelines were too restrictive -- that some theme requirements should be recommendations. On the WP Tavern forums, Justin Tadlock outlined some concerns, specifically that guidelines didn’t allow themes with custom template hierarchies or custom image systems. Some believed the theme review team should check for spam and other objectionable practices. Other developers simply decided to &lt;a href=&quot;http://quirm.net/2010/08/27/retiring-themes/&quot;&gt;remove their themes from the directory&lt;/a&gt;.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manpower was a problem for those reviewing themes. The review queue was clogged with 100 themes by July 2010; new themes were added every day. Only three or four people were actively reviewing themes. Over time, automated processes and new tools have improved the theme review process. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/&quot;&gt;theme check plugin&lt;/a&gt; tests the theme against all of the latest theme review standards.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the teething problems, the theme reviewers have a system that benefits both users and developers: users get safe themes approved by WordPress.org, and theme developers get feedback and help on their themes. There have been other, long-term benefits. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_05_27_Scott.html#L66&quot;&gt;Joseph says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...looking back on it over the long term it&apos;s been nice to see some folks who started way back then and have gone on to be very successful as far as developing their own themes, commercial themes, while still supporting free and open source at the same time. I think over the long term it&apos;s been rewarding to see that jumping off point for people to be able to continue to produce more themes, and very well regarded and high quality themes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the WordPress project settled into concrete groups, communication needed to improve. Core product development was discussed on wpdevel.wordpress.com. Other teams were scattered over mailing lists and wordpress.com blogs. Toward the end of 2010, a new blog network was set up on WordPress.org -- make.WordPress.org became the new home for WordPress contributor teams, with blogs for core, UI, theme review, and accessibility. Over time new blogs such as support, documentation, plugins, and community, were added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each make.WordPress.org blog runs the P2 theme. Created by Automattic for internal communication, P2 is a microblogging tool that allows users to post on the front end -- similar to Twitter -- without the 140-character limit. Threaded comments on posts allow for discussion. Unless made completely open, only people who are editors of a blog can write a post while anyone is able to comment. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;make&quot; blogs are an important centralized space on WordPress.org where contributors gather. If a contributor is interested in core development, they can follow the core blog; forum moderators can follow the support blog; people with a UI focus can follow the UI blog. Contributors can subscribe to the blogs and follow along with what’s going on from their email inboxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By moving everything onto P2-themed blogs on make.WordPress.org, the conversation&apos;s tone has changed -- everything takes place in public. This encourages a more respectful attitude among community members. The focus is on getting work done, rather than devolving into arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of focused communication improvements have helped the project to build capacity and grow. What often happens is that a need appears, a call goes out, and if enough people answer the call, the project moves forward.  This sort of community and capacity building is an important part of running a successful free software project. As the community grows, needs change and new contribution areas open up. A project that grows so far beyond its hacker roots that it encompasses a diverse set of contributors is a healthy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;39. Thesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mid-2010, one theme was still a GPL holdout: Thesis, from DIYThemes. Created by theme designer Chris Pearson and blogger Brian Clark, Thesis was popular as a feature-heavy framework -- it gave users many more options than most WordPress themes. Users can customize every element of their website via the user interface. On the original about page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080610074529/http://diythemes.com/thesis/about/&quot;&gt;Chris states Thesis&apos; aim&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I wanted a framework that had it all -- killer typography, a dynamically resizable layout, intelligent code, airtight optimization, and tons of flexibility.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/2008/07/17/thesis-represents-the-next-generation-of-wordpress-themes/#!A2Baz&quot;&gt;Tech blogs featured Thesis&lt;/a&gt; and high profile bloggers, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/switching-things-around/&quot;&gt;Matt Cutts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbrogan.com/thesis-wordpress-theme/&quot;&gt;Chris Brogan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/18/thesis-a-wordpress-theme-design-worth-considering/&quot;&gt;Darren Rowse&lt;/a&gt; adopted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Pearson was well-respected in the community; he&apos;d already developed Cutline and PressRow before moving into the premium theme market with Thesis. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/&quot;&gt;mid-2009 ThemeShaper post&lt;/a&gt; recalls Thesis&apos; influence as &quot;The Pearson Principle&quot;: &quot;Bloggers want powerfully simple design on an equally robust framework.&quot; With themes such as Revolution and Premium News, theme developers were already creating feature-rich themes, and Thesis cemented that approach, ushering in the era of the theme framework &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/comment-page-1/#comment-9718&quot;&gt;Chris called this approach&lt;/a&gt; &quot;ubiquitous design.&quot; A theme wasn&apos;t simply a website skin, it was a tool to build your website. It took another four years before theme developers stopped packing themes with options and started moving features into plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While theme vendors adopted the GPL, Thesis held out. Discussions &lt;a href=&quot;http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/#comment-59022&quot;&gt;between DIYThemes and Automattic&lt;/a&gt; went nowhere and relationships fractured. In June 2009, Brian and Toni were in discussions when a blogger&apos;s comment thread was &lt;a href=&quot;http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/&quot;&gt;hijacked&lt;/a&gt;. A long debate about Thesis and the GPL ensued. Matt urged people to move away from Thesis, saying &quot;if you care about the philosophical underpinnings of WordPress please consider putting your support behind something that isn&apos;t hostile to WordPress&apos; core freedoms and GPL license.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2010, the WordPress/Thesis debate reignited after Chris Pearson&apos;s interview &lt;a href=&quot;http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-thesis-interview/&quot;&gt;on Mixergy&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Chris shares Thesis&apos; revenue figures, putting a conservative estimate at 1.2 million dollars within 16 to 18 months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over a week later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/18536597161&quot;&gt;Matt and Chris took to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Matt was unhappy about Chris flaunting revenue and the GPL -- violating WordPress&apos; license. Cutting remarks ensued until Andrew Warner from Mixergy set up an &lt;a href=&quot;http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-matt-mullenweg/&quot;&gt;impromptu, live debate to discuss the issues&lt;/a&gt;. The hour-long discussion aired both sides of the argument. Matt argued that Thesis was built on GPL software -- WordPress -- and must honor the license. Matt suggested that Chris was disrespectful of all WordPress authors and that he was breaking the law. Chris said adopting the GPL meant giving up his rights and losing piracy protection. He argued that &quot;what I&apos;ve done stands alone outside of WordPress completely,&quot; and that Thesis &quot;does not inherit anything from WordPress.&quot; The argument descended into a rambling discussion of economics, and the conversation ended when Matt threatened to sue Chris if he refusesed to comply with the GPL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt, Automattic, and WordPress took public action against Thesis following the interview. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/18548422506&quot;&gt;Matt offered to buy Thesis users an alternative premium theme&lt;/a&gt;, consultants using Thesis were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/mg315/4792383313/&quot;&gt;removed from the Code Poet directory of WordPress consultants&lt;/a&gt;, and Chris Pearson&apos;s other themes -- Cutline and PressRow -- were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pearsonified.com/2010/11/former-cutline-pressrow-theme-user.php&quot;&gt;removed from WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt wasn&apos;t the only one in the WordPress community to come out swinging against Thesis. Other lead and core developers wrote about their GPL / Thesis stance. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryan.boren.me/2010/07/15/wordpress-theme-licensing/&quot;&gt;Ryan Boren wrote&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;where do I stand as one of the primary copyright holders of WordPress? I&apos;d like to see the PHP parts of themes retain the GPL. Aside from preserving the spirit of WordPress, respecting the open source ecosystem in which it thrives, and avoiding questionable legal ground, retaining the GPL is practical.&quot; Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/&quot;&gt;noted that WordPress themes don&apos;t sit on top of, they&apos;re interdependent on WordPress&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space. If you followed the code execution for Thesis as it jumped between WordPress core code and Thesis-specific code, you&apos;d get a headache, because you&apos;d be jumping back and forth literally hundreds of times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even developers who believed themes aren&apos;t derivative of WordPress declared Thesis derivative. Developer Drew Blas &lt;a href=&quot;http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/&quot;&gt;wrote a script comparing every line of WordPress and Thesis&lt;/a&gt;. His script revealed several instances of Thesis code taken from WordPress. Core developer Andrew Nacin &lt;a href=&quot;http://nacin.com/2010/07/15/thesis-gpl/&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that Thesis&apos; own inline documentation declared: &quot;This function is mostly copy pasta from WP (&lt;code&gt;wp-includes/media.php&lt;/code&gt;), but with minor alteration to play more nicely with our styling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former employee of DIYThemes &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2010/07/syn-thesis-1/#comment-481845&quot;&gt;left a comment on Matt&apos;s blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;check out Thesis&apos; handling of comments (&lt;code&gt;thesis/lib/classes/comments.php&lt;/code&gt;). Large chunks of it are ripped right from WordPress. I know they are… because I&apos;m the one who did the ripping. Whether I informed Chris of that or not doesn&apos;t matter because I no longer have any of our old chat logs to prove one way or another, but suffice it to say the latest public release of Thesis (and numerous versions before hand) contain obviously GPL code. Whether those portions get rewritten in the impending 3.0 release, I don&apos;t know… but for Chris to claim that he was responsible for and devised all of Thesis at 13:33 or so in the debate… Well, he was lying to you, either intentionally or not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 22, -- not even a week after the initial Mixergy interview -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/19288707443&quot;&gt;Chris Pearson announced&lt;/a&gt; that Thesis would be released under a split license. The public furor, compounded by pressure from inside DIYThemes, forced Chris to capitulate. Brian Clark drafted &lt;a href=&quot;http://technosailor.com/2010/07/29/exclusive-interview-brian-clark-leaves-diythemesthesis-theme/&quot;&gt;the license&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before leaving DIYThemes, citing &quot;completely different opinions about the direction of the development of Thesis, the running of the company, and our relationship with the WordPress community.&quot; When Thesis 2 launched in 2012, it had a new, proprietary license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate around Thesis and the GPL had far-reaching implications for everyone involved. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2010/08/syn-thesis-3-switchers/&quot;&gt;Prominent blogs moved away from Thesis&lt;/a&gt;. Brian Gardner&apos;s Genesis theme became a popular choice. Thesis and Chris Pearson became less prominent in the community, focusing instead on cultivating and building a large customer base. The debacle also proved that WordPress will go to court to defend flagrant license abuse. There was, for a while, a relative calm in the community around the GPL. WordPress.org supported commercial theme sellers whose themes were 100% GPL and tolerated those that packaged their themes with two licenses. It would be another four years before the community found itself in another GPL argument on the four freedoms, this time between WordPress and Envato. &lt;/p&gt;

In some instances, a theme framework is a base, or “starter” theme that a developer can build from. In other cases, it’s a drop-in code library that facilitates development. But it’s also used in marketing to users, when a theme framework is a feature-heavy theme with multiple options.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Story of WordPress - Part 4]]></title><description><![CDATA[You are reading the fourth part of the series, find the whole series at  series/wpbook . 25.

&lt;h2&gt;25. Creating a Folksonomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the exodus to Habari, the project began to evolve. In March 2007, Robin Adrianse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/rob1n&quot;&gt;rob1n&lt;/a&gt;) became WordPress’ first temporary committer when he received commit access for three months to help Ryan Boren address languishing trac tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in March, the plugin directory launched. Before the plugin directory, developers hosted their plugins on their website. The directory gave them exposure to a huge number of WordPress users. Samuel Wood (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42&quot;&gt;Otto42&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_06_07_Wood.html#L204&quot;&gt;recalls how the plugin directory encouraged him to distribute his code&lt;/a&gt;. “I was writing them before, but I didn&apos;t give them to anybody. It encouraged me to release plugins because I had a place to put them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/25/plugin-directory-2007.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WordPress Plugin Directory in 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 2.1 had launched in January 2007, after a release cycle of more than a year. WordPress 2.2 was the first to adopt the new 120-day release cycle. This goal, which would later become codified as &lt;em&gt;deadlines are not arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; in WordPress’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, was an ongoing challenge. It was tested in WordPress 2.2, which featured a new taxonomy system -- the biggest database architecture change to date. Developing in an open source environment means leaving time for every voice to be heard, waiting for volunteers with busy lives to get things done, and discussing new features and architectural changes. It’s a challenge that WordPress would have to address release cycle after release cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, the internet abounded with discussions about the best way to organize information. Content has metadata assigned to it, which can be used to organize and display information. Traditional web classification methods imposed a top-down categorization structure. A website created a category structure and users placed their content in the correct category. These structures were often rigid, forcing users to shoehorn their content into something that didn’t necessarily fit. A new method of classification emerged -- tags, a bottom-up classification form in which an index or a cloud can be generated based on keywords that the creator applies to the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social bookmarking site &lt;a href=&quot;https://delicious.com/&quot;&gt;Del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; was the first to use tags. While Del.icio.us wasn&apos;t a bookmark management pioneer, its tagging system set it apart. Users tag the links they save, and the tags are then used to group together links in a user’s own collection and across the entire social network. Visiting the link &lt;a href=&quot;http://delicious.com/tag/php&quot;&gt;http://delicious.com/tag/php&lt;/a&gt; displays all links tagged PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classification system in which users classify content themselves, creating mass tagging networks, became known as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy&quot;&gt;folksonomy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Technorati, the blog search engine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000270.html&quot;&gt;launched its own tagging system&lt;/a&gt;. It enabled users to run a tag search across major platforms such as Blogger and Typepad, CMSs like Drupal, and other services such as Flickr, Del.icio.us, and Socialtext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress lagged behind, and there was pressure from both the free software and WordPress.com communities to add tags to the platform. WordPress’ native classification form is hierarchical, top-down categories. To interact with WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/adding-technorati-tags-to-wordpressmu-sites/#comment-113)&quot;&gt;Technorati picked up the “tag” from the WordPress post’s category&lt;/a&gt;. Many users found this unsatisfactory, as categories and tags are two different types of classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://carthik.net/blog/vault/2006/02/21/tags-are-not-categories/&quot;&gt;Carthik Sharma wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Categories can be tags but tags cannot be categories. Categories are like the huge signs you see on aisles in supermarkets – “Food”, “Hygiene”, “Frozen,” etc., (sic) they guide you to sections where you can find what you are looking for. Tags are like the labels on the products themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Categories and tags address two distinct use cases. Categories are more rigid, whereas tags are a lightweight way of classifying content. There was, of course, a plugin that did the job: WordPress users installed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/&quot;&gt;Ultimate Tag Warrior&lt;/a&gt; plugin (though WordPress.com users could not).
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3723&quot;&gt;Ryan Boren opened a ticket to add tagging support to WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, WordPress would have tags. The next step was to identify the database schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A database stores all the content and data of a WordPress user. The database contains different tables from which data is retrieved. There is a post table, for example, which stores post-related data. The user table stores user data. Making changes to the database is not trivial. Any changes have to be done correctly because undoing them in the future can be difficult. Changes need to be performant. In a PHP/MySQL setup, increasing the number of database queries can slow the site down. The question arose: where should we store tagging data? Should it be in a new table? Or should it be stored in an existing table?

Ryan proposed two database schemas. One of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/3723/tagging.diff&quot;&gt;created a new table for tags&lt;/a&gt;. Matt was keen on the second proposal -- putting &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/3723/tags.diff&quot;&gt;tags in the categories database table&lt;/a&gt;. He believed it didn’t make sense to create another table identical to the categories table. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3723#comment:16&quot;&gt;comment on trac, he wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We already have a ton of rewrite, API, etc. infrastructure around categories. Mostly I see tagging as a new interface to the data. On the display side, people want their tags listed separately from their categories, and probably something like a tag cloud function.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Previously, WordPress had already successfully reused tables; for example, posts, pages, and attachments are all stored in the same table, and at that time, the categories table also contained link categories. Tagging, from a user’s perspective, enabled them to tag posts, display a list of tags, and display posts with the same tag. What was the point in duplicating the infrastructure when it could be achieved within the current table system?
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011730.html&quot;&gt;Few developers supported&lt;/a&gt; putting tags in the categories table. Some believed the table would become bloated and argued that adding tags to it meant including additional code to keep the two taxonomy types separate. This additional code could introduce bugs, and make future maintenance and extension of the table difficult for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/thread.html&quot;&gt;wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;, April 2007 was spent discussing the new database schema for taxonomies. A suggestion that gained considerable community traction was splitting categories, link categories, and tags into their own individual tables -- but it was impossible to reach consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking in the single-table taxonomy structure (changesets &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5110&quot;&gt;#5110&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5111&quot;&gt;#5111&lt;/a&gt;), Matt posted a new thread on wp-hackers &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011930.html&quot;&gt;making the case for using the categories table&lt;/a&gt;. He argued that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It would perform faster as no additional queries would need to be carried out to support tags. A separate tag table would require at least two extra queries on the front end.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It would provide a better long-term foundation. Tags and categories would be able to share terms (for example the category “dogs” and the tag “dogs”).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There were no user-facing or plugin-facing problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
In the thread, he also proposed an alternative, inspired by Drupal’s taxonomy system: creating a new table for terms within a specific taxonomy. Terms are the items within a category, tag, or any other taxonomy; dog, cat, and chicken are all terms within an “animal” taxonomy. This additional table allowed terms to be shared among taxonomies, while having the same ID (the ID is what identifies an item in the database). Just one term -- “dog” for example -- would be saved in the database, and this term could be used in any taxonomy.
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Boren &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011991.html&quot;&gt;proposed a compromise&lt;/a&gt;, one which enabled individual terms to be part of any taxonomy, while keeping the same ID. It was a three-table solution, with tables for terms, taxonomies, and objects. Discussion ensued, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4189&quot;&gt;new trac ticket was opened up&lt;/a&gt;, and a new structure was created based on this proposal. The first table, wp&lt;em&gt;terms, holds basic information about single terms. The wp&lt;/em&gt;term&lt;em&gt;taxonomy table places the term in a taxonomy. The final table, term&lt;/em&gt;relationships, relates objects (such as posts or links) to a term&lt;em&gt;taxonomy&lt;/em&gt;id from the term_taxonomy table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/25/taxonomy_structure.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;an image showing the current taxonomy structure of WordPress&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The database structure for WordPress taxonomies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach had the advantage of assigning one ID to a term name, while using another table to relate it to a specific taxonomy. It&apos;s extensible for plugin developers who can create their own taxonomies. It also enables large multisite networks, such as WordPress.com, to create global taxonomies -- unified tagging systems in which users of different blogs can share terms within a taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many WordPress features, tags landed on WordPress.com before they shipped in WordPress. From the beginning, the new structure caused huge technical problems. The increase in tables meant that WordPress.com needed more servers to deal with the additional queries. “It was slower to be completely honest,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_07_07_Mullenweg.html#L156&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;. “That was a cost that we saw in a very real way on WordPress.com, but also a hidden cost that we did impose on everyone who was doing WordPress in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than just a challenging code problem, the taxonomy implementation highlighted problems in the development process. Heavy discussion meant development dragged on. Some wanted to delay the release. Some wanted to pull the feature. Others wanted to revise the schema in a subsequent version. Andy Skelton &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011988.html&quot;&gt;responded to the wp-hackers discussion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To include a premature feature in an on-time release degrades the quality of the product. I refer to not only the code but the state of the community. Increments are supposed to be in the direction of better, not merely more. Better would be to release on time with a modest set of stable upgrades.
&lt;p&gt;To block release while the one new feature gets sorted out would be a maladjustment of priorities. If 2.2 seems light on sex appeal, so be it. Better to keep the release date as promised.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The 120-day release schedule was in danger because of one issue. Making major architectural changes to core just weeks before a release was contrary to the aims of the new development process. A thread suggested &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/011901.html&quot;&gt;delaying 2.2&apos;s release&lt;/a&gt;. The architectural changes were too important to be done in an unsatisfactory way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Matt decided to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-April/012090.html&quot;&gt;delay the 2.2 release&lt;/a&gt;, pull tags out of core, and bring in widgets -- a user-facing feature that would encourage people to update their version of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andy.wordpress.com/2006/03/08/widgets-user-interface-and-api/&quot;&gt;Andy Skelton developed widgets&lt;/a&gt; for WordPress.com users; he built them to give bloggers more flexibility with their site&apos;s layout. Widgets are code blocks users can drag and drop into place through the user interface. They allow bloggers to add a calendar, a search bar, or some text (among other things) to a sidebar in any order they wish. It was a hugely popular feature on WordPress.com; the plugin for WordPress was also a great success. Launching widgets on WordPress.com meant that many different users could test them before they made it into core as a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new tagging feature finally shipped in WordPress 2.3 -- in a structure that was the outcome of extensive negotiating and haggling. This wrangling process has had consequences for WordPress developers ever since. Shared terms have had lasting implications for core developers, plugin developers, and users. The problem with shared terms is that an item could have multiple different meanings, but the database treats all of them identically. For example, the word apple. A developer creates the taxonomy “Companies” and the taxonomy “Fruit,” and the user places the term “apple” in both. Conceptually, this is a different item -- a company and a fruit -- and they appear in the user interface as two distinct entities. But the database treats them as the same thing. So if a user makes changes to one -- for example, capitalizing it -- changes are made to both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post in 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/&quot;&gt;Andrew Nacin wrote that&lt;/a&gt;, “Hindsight is 20/20, and shared terms are the bane of taxonomies in WordPress.” Each term is represented in two different ways. Since an individual term can appear in multiple taxonomies, it’s not straightforward to identify the actual term in the actual taxonomy that you want. It has become a challenge to build new features that use one identification method when there are parts of WordPress that use the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point: to attach metadata to a term, there must be one object identifier. However, the public ID uses a different identifier. It is extremely difficult to target data consistently when it is identified in multiple ways. WordPress has a long-term commitment to maintaining backward compatibility, so creating a new schema isn’t possible. The effort to get rid of shared terms must progress step by step, over a number of major releases (this is being carried out over three releases in the 4.x series).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-engineered taxonomy system came about through argument and compromise. When the bazaar model works, it can produce software that people love to use. The model fails when intractable arguments result in compromises that no one is 100 percent happy with. The new taxonomy system did, however, contain one notable benefit. Neither of the original proposals for the taxonomy schema (putting tags into the category table, or creating a new table just for tags) would have allowed developers to create custom taxonomies, and the latter became a major element in WordPress&apos; transition from a straightforward blogging platform to a bonafide content management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these setbacks, software development continued mostly on schedule. Since tags were pulled from 2.2, there were only 114 days between WordPress 2.1 and 2.2, and then 129 days between the release of 2.2 and 2.3. While delays would recur in some future releases, there was nothing that resembled the long, dark year between 2.0 and 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;26. Sponsored Themes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A community of hobbyists drove WordPress for a long time, but eventually, the hobbyists wanted to support their hobby. Developers charged for customizations; Automattic was building a blog network along with related products like Akismet. Theme designers, too, wanted to make money for the time and effort they put into developing themes for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t immediately obvious how someone can make money and still uphold the ethos of a free software project. How can the two goals co-exist? In the early days of the WordPress economy, the distinction between freedom and free beer was blurry. Community members fumbled for answers: is it acceptable to make money with a GPL project?  Who has the right to make money out of a project that belongs to its volunteers? How can one run a theme business when the core product is free? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period between 2006 and 2009 was one of experimentation and discovery for businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. During these tumultuous years, the community wrestled with commercialization while the theme marketplace grew. WordPress users -- web users -- have always been concerned with their websites&apos; look. As WordPress became more popular, many bloggers built their own themes and realized that they could generate income from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes lagged behind plugins for an official repository. For a long time, themes were hosted on themes.wordpress.net, an unofficial theme directory. Theme developers could simply upload their theme and users could browse the directory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/26/theme-viewer-2007.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WordPress Theme Viewer in 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was susceptible to spam and duplicate themes. Some theme developers abused the system by &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080415170633/http://themes.wordpress.net/blog/939/first-spammer-caught/&quot;&gt;downloading their theme multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, to boost their ranking and appear among the most popular search results. The Theme Viewer was at the center of the first big debate about themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme designers tried theme sponsorship as a way to make money from their designs. Designers often use a link to their website in their theme as a credit. Kubrick, for example, links to Michael Heilemann&apos;s website. Every site that installs the theme links to the designer&apos;s website. The number of incoming links to a website is a variable in Google&apos;s PageRank algorithm: the more incoming links, the higher the PageRank, the further up in Google&apos;s search engine results. If thousands (or even hundreds) of people install a theme, the designer can watch herself soar up Google&apos;s search results. If that link comes from a high-authority website, even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designers soon realized the link doesn’t have to be to their own website. Links have an intrinsic value, particularly to internet marketers. With a link in a WordPress theme, marketers don’t have to approach individual sites to ask them for a link. All they have to do is pay a web designer to include it in their theme, release the theme for free, and soon hundreds of sites are linking back to their desired URL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme sponsorship approaches varied. Sometimes, companies contacted well-known theme authors to sell links in their themes. Theme authors could also be proactive. Authors &lt;a href=&quot;http://themey.com/&quot;&gt;advertised and sold their themes on websites&lt;/a&gt;, others auctioned themes at Digital Point, or they simply offered links for sale. In those early days, once the sale was made, designers would promote the theme on different WordPress theme sites, including official sites such as the WordPress Codex, community resources like the WordPress Theme Viewer, and reputable blogs such as Weblog Tools Collection. These themes were often distributed with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons 3.0&lt;/a&gt; license, which permits free sharing and theme adaptation, provided the credit link remains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites focused on making money online became aware of theme sponsorship. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070306065553/http://www.doshdosh.com/link-building-and-seo/link-building-with-word-press-theme-sponsorship-a-good-idea/&quot;&gt;Tutorials and articles about theme sponsorship proliferated&lt;/a&gt;, and sponsorship became part of an acceptable link-building strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some theme creators published themes with visible text links but didn&apos;t tell their users about the link, others used PHP or CSS to hide the links, while others still made it very clear that the theme had been sponsored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130524074921/http://www.headsetoptions.org/2007/04/09/the-other-point-of-view-%E2%80%93-a-designers-opinion-on-sponsored-themes/&quot;&gt;those in favor of theme sponsorship&lt;/a&gt;, the matter was simply about being paid for their work. Why should they work for free? Selling sponsored links ensured they could create and distribute free themes, which benefited the whole community. They argued that designing a good theme takes time and that non-sponsored themes were inevitably of poorer quality than sponsored ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored themes quickly became prevalent, with even respected authors &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2007/04/03/wordpress-theme-release-insense/&quot;&gt;selling links in their themes&lt;/a&gt;. Many considered it a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogherald.com/2007/04/06/sponsored-wordpress-themes-a-great-business-model/&quot;&gt;&quot;great business model&quot;&lt;/a&gt;; finally, a way to make money from WordPress! Besides, those who supported the model argued that the default WordPress blogroll contained links to all of the original developers of WordPress -- Alex, Donncha, Dougal, Michel, Matt, Mike, and Ryan -- all of whom were benefiting in Google&apos;s search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others felt that themes.wordpress.net was becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070409100127/http://blogdesignsolutions.com/2007/03/31/wordpress-theme-sponsorship/&quot;&gt;spam repository&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070417004542/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/04/05/deteriorating-community&quot;&gt;More than 50% of themes&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress Theme Viewer were sponsored themes. These contained links to everything from iPhone repair services to gambling websites, and from web hosting to flower delivery. Some themes were uploaded multiple times with only minor changes, thereby increasing the number of links on the Theme Viewer. Critics of theme sponsorship -- many of whom were designers themselves -- said that the themes polluted the community. They weren&apos;t against theme designers making money, but they didn&apos;t want to see the WordPress community become a hive of spam and SEO tricks. Theme sponsorship had opened the floodgates to SEO and internet marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying and selling links went beyond the WordPress community. A few years earlier, Matt Cutts, the head of web spam at Google, had explained how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/text-links-and-pagerank/&quot;&gt;link-selling affected PageRank&lt;/a&gt;. Google&apos;s algorithm detected paid links, and while it wasn&apos;t foolproof, it worked pretty well. Paid links made it harder for Google to gauge a website&apos;s trustworthiness. As a result, Google took away that site&apos;s ability to affect search results: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Reputable sites that sell links won&apos;t have their search engine rankings or PageRank penalized – a search for [daily cal] would still return dailycal.org. However, link-selling sites can lose their ability to give reputation (e.g. PageRank and anchortext).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress users who installed sponsored themes could be penalized for links that they weren&apos;t even aware they were hosting. And, hidden links could further reduce a user&apos;s PageRank. In a post in April 2007, Matt Cutts condemned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/hidden-links/&quot;&gt;hiding links in a website&lt;/a&gt; and asked web masters to disclose paid links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of themes that contained links that weren&apos;t sponsored. Designers &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080104150212/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/04/11/design-credit-ramblings-again/&quot;&gt;would include a credit link to their website in the theme&apos;s footer&lt;/a&gt;. Designing and releasing a WordPress theme allowed designers to increase their profile on the web. Like internet marketers, their websites benefited from higher search engine results, and website visitors might click on the link, generating more business for the designer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was common at that time for a designer to release their themes under a Creative Commons license, which asks users to leave the credit link intact. In the middle of the sponsored link furor, one designer took the next step. Tung Do (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/tungdo&quot;&gt;tungdo&lt;/a&gt;) authored the popular WordPress resource WPDesigner.com, along with a number of WordPress themes. In April 2007, he announced he would &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080113192235/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/04/10/switching-from-creative-commons-to-gpl/&quot;&gt;release his themes under the GPL&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Despite that I&apos;m just ONE theme designer and despite that I don&apos;t contribute directly the WordPress code (sic),&quot; he wrote, &quot;I believe that switching to GPL is a step in the direction to support the WordPress team and to help the WordPress theme community grow (positively).&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weblog Tools Collection (WLTC) was the first website to take direct action against sponsored themes. At WLTC, designers submitted themes and Mark Ghosh, who ran the site, regularly wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/20/wordpress-theme-releases-for-0420/&quot;&gt;theme releases&lt;/a&gt;. In April, Mark weighed in on sponsored themes. While he didn&apos;t condemn them outright, he did institute a new policy: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All themes with sponsorship links will be labelled as such when they are published, non-sponsored themes will be published first, and we require sponsorship disclosure to be made to us when authors make us aware of their new themes. If this disclosure is not provided and the theme has sponsored links, the author will be barred from being able to post their new themes on weblogtoolscollection.com until further notice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/09/sponsored-themes/#comments&quot;&gt;166 comments Ghosh received&lt;/a&gt; highlighted just how divisive the issue was. Viewpoints ran to both extremes. Many users were unhappy about links being placed in their websites -- this was particularly concerning to people whose websites had a moral or religious bent. While users supported linking to theme authors, they weren’t happy that links for credit cards or flower delivery were being displayed on their website. Theme developers said that it was a way for them to fund themselves and the creation of free themes, and that they were sad to see it being abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, Matt followed Mark&apos;s lead and &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/12/on-sponsored-themes/&quot;&gt;posted on WLTC about sponsored themes&lt;/a&gt;. He had &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/008293.html&quot;&gt;become aware of the trend&lt;/a&gt; back in September 2006, when he had downloaded the Barthelme theme from plaintxt.org and discovered a link to a New York flower delivery service. For him, there were three main issues: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that sponsored links negatively impact a user&apos;s Trustrank and that the user hadn&apos;t made this decision themselves;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that sponsored themes are adware;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that theme authors who sell links and release their work under a creative commons license contravene the GPL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;All of these factors meant a negative experience for WordPress users. While the project allowed people to make money from WordPress-related products and services, it didn&apos;t support methods detrimental to users. Whatever the original intentions of sponsored links, themes had become so polluted that they undermined the trust that a user had in the software and in the community. As a user-focused community, the project needed to regain that trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument that theme authors deserved to be compensated for their work held little weight when WordPress itself had been built by volunteers. There was no opposition to people making money from WordPress, but official project resources should only promote companies and individuals in line with the core project ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt closed the post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/ideas/topic/remove-sponsored-themes-from-wordpressorg&quot;&gt;linking to a vote&lt;/a&gt; on a proposal to remove sponsored themes from WordPress.org. The discussion on the thread has arguments for and against theme sponsorship; some voted for a complete ban, others for sponsored theme disclosure, while others felt theme designers should be allowed to include any links they want in their theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the results of the vote, the tide turned against sponsored themes. These were not looked upon favorably at WordPress.org, with sites and people who had promoted sponsored themes already &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-theme-hockey&quot;&gt;banned from the forums&lt;/a&gt;. Even Matt Cutts weighed in, saying that he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/by-the-way-2&quot;&gt;agreed 100 percent with Matt’s position on sponsored themes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Mark announced on WLTC that he &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/10/no-sponsored-themes-on-weblogtoolscollection/&quot;&gt;would no longer promote sponsored themes&lt;/a&gt;, and shortly after, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2007/07/wltc-high-ground/&quot;&gt;Matt announced that all sponsored themes would be removed from themes.WordPress.net&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a positive reaction from much of the community, there was a backlash, primarily directed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/16/turning-the-other-cheek/&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2007/07/love-and-hate/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some theme developers saw theme sponsorship as a valid way of making money, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130523083509/http://www.mandarinmusing.com/2007/07/14/if-i-could-walk-on-water-you%E2%80%99d-complain-i-can%E2%80%99t-swim/&quot;&gt;were angry&lt;/a&gt; about being branded as &quot;unethical.&quot; This was particularly the case when they saw other theme developers behaving unethically, from downvoting other developers&apos; themes and using sock puppetry to upvote their own, to stuffing themes with copious links to their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the sponsored theme ban on official WordPress resources, link sales continue today. The Digital Point forums, for example, are filled with themes available for sponsorship. Theme sponsorship is not without its dangers. In 2012, a former theme sponsor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmasterworld.com/google/4445558.htm&quot;&gt;posted on the Webmaster world forums&lt;/a&gt; about Google penalization for &quot;inorganic&quot; incoming links: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some 2+ years ago in throws (sic) of questionable wisdom I sponsored about five or six WordPress themes where the &quot;Designed by&quot; link in the footer gets replaced by a link to your site. They were nice looking and &quot;relevant&quot; themes, at least as far as the name and pictures used in design suggest. They were not used much initially and I did not think much of them until these &quot;unnatural links&quot; notices started flying a month ago. Google confirmed that these links were the issue, but with the themes in the wild there wasn&apos;t a whole lot that the sponsor could do about it other than contact the websites using the theme and asking them to remove the link.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored themes were the first large-scale attempt at making money from WordPress themes. Custom design and development existed too, but link sales appeared to be a valid way of making money, particularly at a period when the web teemed with SEO experts and internet marketers on an unremitting search for ways to climb Google&apos;s search results. Sponsored themes brought WordPress, not for the first time, into proximity with SEO, both white hat and black hat. Selling links in a theme slipped easily into questionable SEO practices; it also turned out to be an unsustainable business model. With Google as the rule-maker, a simple policy change could wipe out an entire market. And as sponsored themes started to disappear from the community, theme designers and developers looked for new ways to support their hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;27. Update notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Westwood became a core committer in July 2007, bringing the number of people who could commit code to four. Westi got involved in the project in 2004 while working as a software engineer -- he had written a script that downloaded WordPress and installed it on a server. He helped with the Codex, and found and fixed bugs. Like many other developers, he had little PHP experience when he came to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wp-hackers mailing list was in its third year, but productive discussion there diminished over time. More and more decision-making happened elsewhere. For example, in February 2007, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3862&quot;&gt;Ryan integrated phpmailer with WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. The code was committed after a short discussion on trac. It wasn’t until September that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014497.html&quot;&gt;phpmailer conversation took place on wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt; -- one that few committers participated in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges on the mailing list inclined less toward development, and more toward &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015058.html&quot;&gt;meta-discussions about the mailing list itself&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015173.html&quot;&gt;high signal-to-noise ratio&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-October/015489.html&quot;&gt;ideas to improve mailing list etiquette&lt;/a&gt;. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andy.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/wp-hackers/&quot;&gt;Andy Skelton wrote about the problem with wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is just one thing I want to make clear about wp-hackers: a hacker is not someone who discusses or pays lip service or dissents or casts a vote or says what can or should be done. Hackers aren’t committee members. Hackers are more interested in proving what can be done than arguing about it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was too much talking and not enough hacking on wp-hackers, and opinion often swayed conversations rather than fact. Mailing lists can become dominated by people who have time to comment, rather than those doing the work. The latter might have the most valuable feedback, but they’re often too busy to keep up with a high-traffic mailing list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress isn’t alone in this phenomenon. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://sback.it/publications/msr2013.pdf&quot;&gt;2013 study of the Apache Lucene mailing list&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) found that “although the declared intent of development mailing list communication is to discuss project internals and code changes/additions, only 35 percent of the email threads regard the implementation of code artefacts.” As well as discussing development, mailing list participants discussed social norms and behavior. The study also found that project developers participate in less than 75 percent of the discussions, and start only half of them. Developers prefer to communicate on the issue-tracking software -- a finding resonant with WordPress, as developers ultimately switched from the mailing list to WordPress trac. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailing lists tend toward bike shed discussions, &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a term derived from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s law of triviality&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless discussions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An atomic plant is so vast that only very few people can grasp it. The board of directors assume that somebody has the knowledge and has done the groundwork. In contrast, everyone can build a bike shed, so everyone has an opinion on how it should be done, and especially what color it should be painted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;Producing Open Source Software&lt;/em&gt;, Karl Fogel notes that as the technical difficulty of an issue goes down, the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#bikeshed&quot;&gt;probability of meandering goes up&lt;/a&gt;:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...consensus is hardest to achieve in technical questions that are simple to understand and easy to have an opinion about, and in &quot;soft&quot; topics such as organization, publicity, funding, etc. People can participate in those arguments forever, because there are no qualifications necessary for doing so, no clear ways to decide (even afterward) if a decision was right or wrong, and because simply outwaiting other discussants is sometimes a successful tactic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its community growth and low barrier to entry, the WordPress project has been susceptible to bike shed discussions like any other free software project. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Flists.wordpress.org%2Fpipermail%2Fwp-hackers%2F+bikeshed&amp;amp;oq=site%3A&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j69i58j69i59j69i65l3.2535j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=91&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=strict&amp;amp;q=site:http:%2F%2Flists.automattic.com%2Fpipermail%2Fwp-hackers%2F+bikeshed&quot;&gt;Google search for “bikeshed” on the wp-hackers mailing list&lt;/a&gt; displays the discussions in which someone has cried “bike shed,” as does a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=bikeshed&amp;amp;noquickjump=1&amp;amp;changeset=on&amp;amp;ticket=on&quot;&gt;similar search on trac&lt;/a&gt;.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, for example, discussion about what to call links got heated. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-June/013299.html&quot;&gt;member of wp-hackers asked&lt;/a&gt;, “Anyone know why it&apos;s still called Blogroll in admin, when it&apos;s called Bookmarks in functions (wp&lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt;bookmarks) and yet displays by default as a list of &quot;Links&quot; in the sidebar?” The original post, &quot;Blogroll, Bookmarks, Links,&quot; generated a total of 79 emails on the mailing list alone, and the discussion spilled &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3695&quot;&gt;over to a trac ticket&lt;/a&gt;.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one person’s bike shed is another person’s bête noire, and there were times when wp-hackers was alight with community members who insisted on giving specific issues serious consideration. One such instance was in early September 2007, before the release of WordPress 2.3, which contained the update notification system. This system alerts users when a new version of WordPress or of a plugin becomes available to install. &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1476&quot;&gt;The system&lt;/a&gt; collects information about the WordPress version, PHP version, locale setting, and the website’s URL from a user’s site, and sends it back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.wordpress.org&quot;&gt;http://api.wordpress.org&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5913&quot;&gt;further piece of code&lt;/a&gt; carries a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4795&quot;&gt;plugin update check&lt;/a&gt;, which sends the website’s URL, WordPress version, and plugin info (including inactive plugins) to api.wordpress.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, the data collection appeared contrary to the free software project ethos. They thought that &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014860.html&quot;&gt;collecting the blog URL was unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. A ticket on WordPress trac &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5066&quot;&gt;requested that update checking be anonymized&lt;/a&gt;. Others had no problem with WordPress collecting the data, but were &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014919.html&quot;&gt;unhappy that WordPress did not disclose it&lt;/a&gt;. A number of people who didn’t oppose the changes nevertheless felt that there should be a way to opt out, so that users who required complete privacy would be able to turn off data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This debate goes to the heart of one of WordPress&apos; design philosophies: &lt;em&gt;decisions, not options&lt;/em&gt;. This idea is heavily influenced by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html&quot;&gt;2002 article written by GNOME contributor Havoc Pennington&lt;/a&gt;. Many free software user interfaces cram in options so that they can be configured in multiple ways. If an argument ensues in a software project about whether something should or shouldn’t be added, a superficial solution is to add an option. The more options one adds, the more unwieldy a user interface becomes. Pennington writes, &quot;preferences have a cost [..], each one has a price and you have to consider its value.” He outlines the problem with too many options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When there are too many preferences it’s difficult for a user to find them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can damage QA and testing. Some bugs only happen when a certain configuration of options is selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They make creating a good UI difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They keep people from fixing real bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can confuse users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The space that you have for preferences is finite so fill it wisely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress developers carefully consider the introduction of any new option, and have become better at it over time. When the data collection question arose, they were extremely reluctant to introduce new options. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015119.html&quot;&gt;Westi posted to wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the core design ideas for WordPress is that we don&apos;t introduce options lightly. The moment you think of making a feature optional you challenge the argument for introducing the feature in the beginning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What benefit would an opt-out button for update notifications provide to users? The purpose of the notifications is to help users to stay up-to-date and secure. Adding an option to opt out of update notifications would only reduce the number of people who updated their sites, and increase the number of insecure instances of WordPress. The benefit to adding the option didn’t outweigh the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, and despite the extensive discussion on wp-hackers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2007/09/wordpress-23/&quot;&gt;WordPress 2.3 was launched as planned&lt;/a&gt;, with the following note in the announcement post:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our new update notification lets you know when there is a new release of WordPress or when any of the plugins you use has an update available. It works by sending your blog URL, plugins, and version information to our new api.wordpress.org service which then compares it to the plugin database and tells you whats (sic) the latest and greatest you can use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/015014.html&quot;&gt;first version of a privacy policy on WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid these discussions, the project structure changed when &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2007/09/new-faces/&quot;&gt;Peter Westwood and Mark Jaquith became lead developers&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement post describes them as “a few old faces who are taking on bigger roles in the community.” Both were active committers who had taken on greater leadership roles. Both had participated in many of the more challenging discussions in the community, and they didn&apos;t always agree with current project leadership. They both, for example, opposed Matt’s proposal for the taxonomy structure, and Mark was one of the people who voiced concerns over data collection in WordPress 2.3. They added new perspectives to the project leadership: for the first time since the early days of the project, there were people other than Matt and Ryan to help guide and shape development of both the software and the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;28. Happy Cog Redesign&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shuttle had failed back in 2006 and WordPress&apos; admin still needed a redesign. Matt turned to design studio Happy Cog. Jeffrey Zeldman, Happy Cog founder, led the project, along with WordPress&apos; logo designer Jason Santa Maria and UX designer Liz Danzico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas Shuttle focused on aesthetics, Happy Cog identified and corrected information architecture problems, and updated and improved WordPress&apos; look and feel. Despite the project&apos;s user-first ethos, the admin screens had become cluttered, as new features were sometimes added in a haphazard way. The change between WordPress 1.5 and WordPress 2.3 speaks for itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;WordPress 1.5 write screen&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/28/wp_1_5.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Write screen in WordPress 1.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;WordPress 2.3 write screen&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/28/wp_2_3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Write screen in WordPress 2.3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Cog produced designs that WordPress developers then coded. The project included user research and an interface audit to identify WordPress&apos; strengths and weaknesses, and to inform new structural and interface designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress, as a free software project, was an unusual client for a traditional design agency. Matt and Jeffrey formed a buffer between the Happy Cog team and the community, but the designers, nonetheless, knew this was an entirely different type of client. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_01_22_Santa_Maria.html#L82&quot;&gt;Jason Santa Maria says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any other client will have customers and their own community, but you really have to just manage the people inside of a company, whereas when you’re dealing with an open source project, you deal with the people that you’re talking with, but there’s this whole gamut of other people that you will only ever get to talk to a small portion of. I think that that’s really difficult.
&lt;p&gt;Plus, I think that on an open source project like this, it’s inherently different, not just because it’s more of a CMS than an informational website -- the design needs are different -- but it’s just a different kind of way to work, knowing that whatever you do probably isn’t going to stick around for very long. It’s going to continue to evolve and continue to be adapted. Usually, in the very near-term as well, not even three-four months from now, but next week.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audit and usability review were among the first steps. Liz Danzico researched and produced a 25-page document on WordPress. WordPress needed an admin that didn’t intrude on the user. In the audit, she quotes &lt;a href=&quot;http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/engine-awareness/&quot;&gt;Mark Jaquith&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;That’s when I know WordPress is doing its job: when people aren’t even aware they’re using it because they’re so busy using it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz spoke to Mark Riley, whose support forum experience gave him direct access to users&apos; complaints. One of the major problems he highlighted was the clutter that had amassed in the Write screen between WordPress 1.2 and WordPress 2.0. Features had been added and then tucked into modules using the pods introduced by the Shuttle project. There were many actions a user could take on the Write screen, and many of them were confusing or hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion focused on navigation structure: labelling, position, and functionality grouping. Should they go with an object-oriented navigation (Posts, Pages, Comments, etc.) or an action-oriented navigation (Write, Manage, etc.)? Liz&apos;s first hunch -- supported by the newly launched Tumblr -- was that users preferred navigating by nouns. She felt WordPress’ verb structure was confusing. The first navigational structure iterations introduced both a noun version and a verb version. In the end, however, and after limited user testing, the team went with a mixture of nouns and verbs: Write, Manage, Design, Comments. This meant that the functionality for different content types was scattered over different menu items -- to write a post, for example, users would go to &quot;Write.&quot; To manage the same post they would navigate to &quot;Manage.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Cog provided extensive and detailed proposals and research for WordPress, and shared them with Matt. Their reports display a sensitivity to web users, and an appreciation for simplifying and streamlining WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to the design stage, Jason Santa Maria created three designs to present to Matt, who would choose one to move forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He designed three early mockups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Happy Cog design 1&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/28/happy-cog-design-a.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mockup Number 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Happy Cog design 2&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/28/happy-cog-design-b.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mockup Number 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Happy Cog design 3&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/28/happy-cog-design-c.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mockup Number 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt chose the visually lighter design. Jason had taken Shuttle&apos;s heavy blue palette and lightened the interface. An orange accent color complemented the lighter blues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the design was finally signed off, WordPress trunk started to transform. As changes took place, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017849.html&quot;&gt;community feedback&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017850.html&quot;&gt;posted to wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;. Was the admin actually more usable? Major changes broke familiar patterns. Some comments compared the design to Shuttle&apos;s; a few community members even &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/02/wordpress-24-admin-preview/#comment-1207158&quot;&gt;wanted to implement Shuttle&apos;s interface&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before release, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/&quot;&gt;a sneak peek was posted to the development blog&lt;/a&gt;, and WordPress users installed the release candidate to get a better look. The response echoed that of the rest of the community. Regular WordPress users were surprised by the functionality changes to the Write screen. For some, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neatorama.com/2008/04/21/wordpress-25-admin-backend-category-shenanigans-and-how-to-fix-it/#!vG29i&quot;&gt;a step backward&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The write screen in the WordPress 2.5 admin&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/28/2_5_admin.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Write screen in the WordPress 2.5 admin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 2.4 was the first version to fall significantly behind the 120-day release cycle. Versions 2.2 and 2.3 were mostly on schedule, but the Happy Cog redesign brought in major changes to the codebase. Rather than just delaying release, a version was skipped, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-January/016993.html&quot;&gt;moving straight from WordPress 2.3 to WordPress 2.5&lt;/a&gt;, which was scheduled for release in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were bigger problems with this release cycle than just the delay. The community felt that they had not been consulted; they felt disenfranchised. In some ways, the redesign was destined to fail before it even began. With no participation and no process, there was no way to ensure community buy-in. Jeffrey Zeldman, reflecting on the process, says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It worked for us, from our perspective, that we were a small team reporting to a single client who had life or death approval over everything. We had to please one user: Matt. He could say yes or no. We completely bypassed the community. That enabled us to get a design done that we felt was crisp and focused and achieved certain goals. And that sounds great. Except that, because the community wasn&apos;t involved, inevitably, the design then became unpopular because nobody got their say in it. And if I could go back and do it again, I would involve them up front, and find ways to get my feedback without it turning into a committee clustercuss. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Shuttle before it, problems surfaced in the design process. Free software projects are collaborative enterprises; when part of the process moves behind closed doors to avoid the problems of working by committee, new problems arise. However much a project tries to avoid it, that committee exists and must have its say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;29. Premium Themes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of sponsored themes, theme developers were looking for ways to make money. Some made money from customizations, but increasingly, people wanted to make money with WordPress products rather than with services. Why build one site when you can build one theme and sell it multiple times? If theme developers couldn’t sell links, they could do the next best thing -- sell themes directly to WordPress users. There was, however, some hesitation around this. When the project removed sponsored themes from official resources, people interpreted this in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;WordPress doesn&apos;t support sponsored themes.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;WordPress doesn&apos;t want me to make money.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Automattic doesn&apos;t want me to make money.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people felt that Matt only wanted Automattic to make money from WordPress, a situation that wasn&apos;t helped when, after the sponsored themes debate, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2007/11/wpcom-marketplace-idea/&quot;&gt;Matt announced a WordPress.com theme marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/01/wordpress-theme-marketplace-hypocrisy-from-matt/&quot;&gt;cries of hypocrisy&lt;/a&gt;. Despite laying the initial groundwork, Automattic decided not to go ahead with the plan. &quot;It didn&apos;t seem right to go into it when we hadn&apos;t really worked out all the licensing issues yet,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_01_Mullenweg.html#L157&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the WordPress.com theme marketplace was set aside, employees inside Automattic were still curious about whether people would pay for a blog design. Noël Jackson (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/noel&quot;&gt;noel&lt;/a&gt;), a former Automattic employee, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_03_23_Jackson.html#L48&quot;&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; the time when premium WordPress themes started to appear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was interesting, especially in the beginning when it started happening. It was interesting to see revenue figures for themes that were released as a premium theme -- not a WordPress.com premium theme -- but someone selling their theme and keeping the GPL license and thinking, &quot;Well, people are actually buying this.&quot; There wasn&apos;t an issue with it. I think that made everybody happy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloggers who used WordPress dabbled with making themes. They released them for free. “A funny dynamic happened,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_05_11_Miller.html#L10&quot;&gt;recalls Cory Miller&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/corymiller303&quot;&gt;corymiller303&lt;/a&gt;), the founder of iThemes. “People started hitting my contact form and saying will you customize this, or will you do this theme, or will you do all that stuff, and I was like I’m, I’m kind of a fraud here. And so I started charging for my work.” This is the familiar tale that some of the most prominent WordPress business founders tell today. Many of the people who run these businesses started out simply by making themes. These were often accidental businesses, with accidental businesspeople -- people who came to the community to scratch their own itch and found themselves inundated with requests for help, support, and customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although sites like Template Monster sold WordPress themes as early as 2006, the last quarter of 2007 saw the first surge in WordPress premium theme releases from within the WordPress community. Brian Gardner&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070825022722/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/the-revolution-begins.htm&quot;&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt; --  one of the first premium WordPress themes -- launched in August 2007. A few weeks after, Tung Do released &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20071016132417/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/09/10/showcase/&quot;&gt;Showcase&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year also marked the launches of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/premium-wordpress-themes/&quot;&gt;Proximity&lt;/a&gt; from Nathan Rice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080202093724/http://www.solostream.com/2007/10/28/wordpress-theme-solostream-40/&quot;&gt;Solostream&lt;/a&gt; from Michael Pollock, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080106173642/http://designadaptations.com/notebook/a-cornerstone-to-build-from/#comment-2836&quot;&gt;Cornerstone Theme&lt;/a&gt; from Charity Ondriezek, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20071106033124/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/11/02/the-launch-of-premium-news-theme&quot;&gt;Premium News Theme&lt;/a&gt; from Adii Pienaar, and PortfolioPress from Magnus Jepson. Early the following year, Chris Pearson released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pearsonified.com/2008/03/diy-themes-pre-launch.php&quot;&gt;Thesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the theme vendors followed a similar path: from blogger to hobbyist themer. From releasing a free theme to testing the brand-new market. Few had career aspirations -- these were side projects to make them money in their spare time. Some also did independent development for clients. But the idea that selling WordPress themes could be big business didn&apos;t cross their minds. &quot;Even when I quit my job to spend more time working on these themes,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_03_05_Pienaar.html#L63&quot;&gt;says Adii Pienaar&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/adii&quot;&gt;adii&lt;/a&gt;), co-founder of WooThemes, &quot;and eventually rebranding and calling that effort WooThemes, I still thought that I was going to build a business around the custom design/development stuff, around consulting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045548/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/how-much-would-you-pay-for-a-premium-theme.htm&quot;&gt;Theme sellers&lt;/a&gt; weren&apos;t sure how to price and license their themes. There was no community consensus about licensing and nothing clear from the project. Theme authors created their own license. A common model was offering a single-use license to use a theme on one site, and a developer or bulk license to use a theme on more than one site. These licenses restricted the number of sites on which a theme could be installed, and what the user could do with a theme. Some, for example, required that the user retain the author credit in the theme, which enabled the authors &lt;a href=&quot;http://diythemes.com/thesis/remove-attribution-link/&quot;&gt;to charge users to remove the attribution link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users downloaded a free theme at no cost, or paid for a premium one. The label “premium,” however, implied that paid themes were &lt;em&gt;intrinsically better&lt;/em&gt;, as though attaching a price tag elevated premium themes above free (and theoretically inferior) themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These commercial themes were often branded as “premium themes,” but there was little consensus about what made a theme “premium.” When Weblog Tools Collection (WLTC) asked, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/&quot;&gt;What Makes a WordPress Theme Premium?&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/#comments&quot;&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt; from community members were varied: &quot;better documentation and support,&quot; &quot;less bloggy,&quot; &quot;better design,&quot; &quot;better features,&quot; &quot;better code,&quot; and &quot;more functionality.&quot; Several people argued that money was the only difference between free and premium themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What distinguished designers and developers making free and premium themes was the time and effort they put into them, and the level of effort required to set them up. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/wordpress/free-vs-premium/&quot;&gt;an interview in June 2008&lt;/a&gt;, premium theme developer Darren Hoyt talks about the differences between creating a free and premium theme. He outlines his considerations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That hand-coding and tweaks to the files should be minimized with the inclusion of a custom control panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That users shouldn’t have to download plugins so all theme functionality was bundled with it. &quot;We tried to make Mimbo Pro more than just a theme or &apos;skin&apos; and more like an application unto itself.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That best practices for commenting code, valid markup, and well-written CSS are followed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That documentation be provided and evolve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That buyers get ongoing support and interactions with the developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Gardner, designer of Revolution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php&quot;&gt;said in a March 2008 interview&lt;/a&gt; that for him, a premium theme differs in how the site looks and acts. &quot;If people respond to a site and say &apos;wow, I can&apos;t believe WordPress is behind that,&apos; that&apos;s what premium themes are all about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attitudes varied widely between users, developers, and other community members. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php&quot;&gt;user who interviewed Brian Gardner&lt;/a&gt; was a keen Revolution advocate. He commends the guaranteed support, comfort, safety, and the feeling that he&apos;s being looked after. A price tag doesn’t necessarily equate to these things, but some premium theme developers make customer support a priority -- and their theme sales rise. WordPress was no longer confined to the world of personal blogging. Businesses, particularly small businesses, used WordPress to build their websites. Paying a small fee for peace of mind was a worthwhile trade-off; it brought the promise of ongoing support. A free theme came with no guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some theme developers were frustrated by premium theme sellers. &quot;&apos;Premium,&apos; when it comes to WordPress themes,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeshaper.com/2008/02/28/the-future-of-premium-wordpress-themes/&quot;&gt;writes Ian Stewart in 2008&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandstewart&quot;&gt;iandstewart&lt;/a&gt;), &quot;simply means &apos;it costs money&apos; and not &apos;of superior quality.&apos;&quot; The false dichotomy set up by the &quot;premium&quot; label undervalues themes released for free. Justin Tadlock (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady&quot;&gt;greenshady&lt;/a&gt;) released the Options theme to &lt;a href=&quot;http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/02/24/options-wordpress-theme&quot;&gt;prove&lt;/a&gt; that there was nothing to stop developers from releasing a free theme fully packed with bells and whistles. He was one of the first to explore an alternative business model, setting up his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/05/31/project-m&quot;&gt;theme club&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to theme sales, he wanted to create a community around theme releases and support. Later that year, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/08/05/wordpress-theme-club-launch&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; Theme Hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of whether someone &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be selling themes wasn’t clear-cut. Some thought that you had to choose: you could either be involved in the community, or make money selling themes or plugins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a discussion on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018694.html&quot;&gt;wp-hackers thread from March 2008&lt;/a&gt;, the author concluded that a person either focused on making money or contributing to the community. But Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018792.html&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the two aren’t mutually exclusive: it’s possible to make money with WordPress, while still making a positive contribution to the project. In the same thread, Matt outlined how he saw businesses best interacting with the WordPress community: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A GPL software community is like the environment. Yes you could make profit building widgets in your widget factory and not pay any heed to the forests you&apos;re clearing or the rivers your (sic) polluting, but in a few years you&apos;re going to start to deplete the commons, and your business and public perception will be in peril...Contrast that with sustainable development, with giving back to the community that sustains (and ultimately consumes) your services and you have the makings of something that could be around for generations to come.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt didn&apos;t see the premium theme market as in step with the community. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018780.html&quot;&gt;proclaimed premium theme sellers were in&lt;/a&gt; &quot;murky waters,&quot; pointing out that there wasn’t much money in the enterprise. In a 2009 conversation with Ptah Dunbar, Matt said that he didn&apos;t like where premium WordPress themes were going, and that the premium theme market wasn&apos;t helping the community to grow.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the community&apos;s perception, users pay for themes, and companies that sell themes make money. Take ThemeForest, for example. The marketplace sells themes and templates for WordPress and different CMSs, as well as HTML templates. Upon launch in September 2008, ThemeForest sold mostly HTML templates; WordPress themes were 25% of sales. By September 2009, WordPress themes were 40% of all ThemeForest sales. In 2013, WordPress themes were 60% of all sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions weren’t just focused on whether people should make money from WordPress. A bigger question was: how should themes be licensed? WordPress itself is licensed under the GPL. The GPL&apos;s copyleft distribution terms ensure that distributions and modifications of the software carry the same license. Derivative works also carry the license. Is a theme derivative of WordPress? There were arguments for and against, speculation, and opinion -- much of which was based on interpretations (or secondhand interpretations) of the license. Court cases are rarely fought around the GPL. Those that come close are often settled out of court, as with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsf.org/news/2008-12-cisco-suit&quot;&gt;Free Software Foundation vs. Cisco lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, which happened at the same time as the WordPress community&apos;s debate over WordPress themes. The community was divided into two camps -- those who thought themes didn&apos;t have to be GPL, and those who thought they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different factors, and one is whether a WordPress install and its theme is an &quot;aggregation&quot; or a &quot;combination.&quot; The GPL FAQ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#MereAggregation&quot;&gt;distinguishes between the two&lt;/a&gt;: an aggregate means putting two programs side by side (like on a hard disc or a CD-ROM). People who thought that themes don’t have to be GPL argued that WordPress with a theme is an aggregate. They believed that a theme modifies the output of WordPress, but doesn’t necessarily engage with its internals. WordPress core developers, however, stated &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/theme-licensing?replies=22#post-543507&quot;&gt;that themes use WordPress core internals&lt;/a&gt;. For a theme to be completely independent, it would need to use none of WordPress&apos; internal functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who accepted that PHP was linked with WordPress in such a way that the theme inherited the GPL, there was still another possibility: distributing with two licenses -- which is what people often refer to as a &quot;split license&quot; -- or &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8843&quot;&gt;what Matt described as&lt;/a&gt; &quot;packaging gymnastics.&quot; While the PHP in a WordPress theme works with WordPress internal functions, the CSS, JavaScript, and images do not. Therefore, a theme developer can package their theme with two licenses: one for the PHP and one for the other files. For theme authors concerned about piracy and copyright, this protected their intellectual property, while ensuring they followed the letter of the GPL. For the project, however, this was simply an evasive game that did an injustice to the spirit of the GPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piracy was a major concern for many theme authors. They worried that anyone could buy their theme, legally distribute it, and even sell it.  Putting a proprietary license on a theme, however, doesn’t stop people from distributing them. Themes from commercial sellers cropped up on torrent sites all over the web and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080915174028/http://www.adii.co.za/2008/02/17/pirated-wordpress-themes-get-a-100-theme-for-only-6/&quot;&gt;were sold on forums such as Digital Point for a cut price&lt;/a&gt;. It was easy, if a user wanted, to download a commercial theme for free (though it often came loaded with additional links and malware). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fears were around making money. How could a business make money by selling a product that the buyer had a right to give away -- or even sell themselves? Designers and developers were reluctant to distribute with a license that they thought would damage their business. While Matt suggested they look into doing custom development, theme sellers were interested in selling products. It&apos;s more immediately obvious how you can scale a business selling products than with services. After all, if you don&apos;t factor in support and upgrades, it&apos;s possible to sell a digital product ad infinitum, creating a relatively passive income for yourself. Time and resources constrain doing custom design or development for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revolution was the first theme to be distributed with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081004003406/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/revolution-going-open-source.htm&quot;&gt;100% GPL license&lt;/a&gt;. Brian Gardner, Revolution’s developer, has a typical theme developer story -- he started as a tinkerer, did some contract work, started to sell themes, and realized he could make a business out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers often came to the project with an implicit awareness of the free software and hacker ethos; they were comfortable with sharing code. Theme sellers came through another route: first they were bloggers, then tinkerers, then designers. As opposed to developers, theme sellers believed they had to protect their designs. &quot;I and others that were starting to sell themes at that point wanted to protect our work,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_03_31_Gardner.html#L36&quot;&gt;says Brian&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We were almost scared of the open source concept where the design and images and the code we felt was all ours and really wasn&apos;t derivative of WordPress itself so we sold things on a proprietary level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8841&quot;&gt;Matt&apos;s ThemeShaper blog comment&lt;/a&gt; made Brian reconsider his stance. Matt wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I&apos;m happy to give significant promotion to theme designers who stop fighting the license of the platform which enabled their market to exist in the first place, just email me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the encouragement that Brian needed. He emailed Matt to tell him he was interested. Before making the switch, Brian &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081002042856/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/meeting-with-matt-mullenweg.htm&quot;&gt;flew to San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081003091633/http://www.wpelements.com/2008/09/29/from-seattle-to-san-francisco-and-back/&quot;&gt;fellow theme author Jason Schuller&lt;/a&gt; to talk to Toni and Matt. They discussed why theme sellers were using proprietary licenses and their fears around piracy. Matt and Toni made it plain: they were happy for theme sellers to make money, but themes needed to be GPL. In all of the confusion around the GPL, the message had become mixed. Theme sellers thought that they were expected to give themes away, not just that they were expected to distribute themes matching WordPress&apos; principles of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after the meeting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081002153427/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/revolution-going-open-source.htm&quot;&gt;Brian announced that in the future, Revolution would be GPL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081004031211/http://www.wpelements.com/2008/10/01/revolution-is-going-open-source-and-im-going-to-join-him/&quot;&gt;Jason Schuller followed suit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of these debates, themes found a new home on WordPress.org. The theme viewer that had been hosted on themes.wordpress.net &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080404175227/http://themes.wordpress.net/blog/4421/version-30/#more-4421&quot;&gt;was riddled with problems&lt;/a&gt;: themes had security holes, and many of them had obfuscated code. The system was continually being gamed, there were duplicate themes, and many contained spam. The theme directory on WordPress.org was set up to rectify this; it was a place developers could host their themes, and where users could find quality WordPress themes. In July 2008, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2008/07/theme-directory/&quot;&gt;the Theme Directory launched on WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;, using bbPress (which, at that time, was not a plugin), making it easier than ever to distribute free themes.&lt;/p&gt;

In his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://producingoss.com/&quot;&gt;Producing Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, he reprints &lt;a href=&quot;http://bikeshed.com/&quot;&gt;an email from Poul-Henning Kamp&lt;/a&gt; to the FreeBSD mailing list with the title “A bike shed (any color will do) on greener grass…,” in which Kamp uses the “painting the bikeshed” analogy to describe discussions on the mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;12. Themes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templating was the next area ripe for improvement -- users could extend their blog and have it in their own language, but there wasn&apos;t yet an easy way to change their site’s design. Even in the b2 forums, many support questions were about changing a website’s design. A blog is a visual representation of the author, their tastes, and their interests -- a blog is a home on the internet, and, just as with any home, owners decorate it according to their tastes. To change the look of a b2 or early WordPress blog, the user had to create a CSS stylesheet. This changed the colors and layout on the front end. However, it didn’t offer any real flexibility in site design; a robust templating system was needed. Michel had looked into creating a templating system for b2, but it was not until the transition between WordPress 1.2 and 1.5 that WordPress got its theme system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of research went into finding the best approach to templating. Smarty templates came up again and again. Smarty is a PHP templating system that allows the user to change the front end independently from the back end. The user can change their site&apos;s design without having to worry about the rest of the application. There &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/smarty-and-smarttemplate/&quot;&gt;are a number of posts&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress.org development blog discussing Smarty&apos;s merits. &lt;a href=&quot;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/530&quot;&gt;Donncha even imported it to the repository&lt;/a&gt; (his first commit to the project). But, despite sharing PHP with WordPress, Smarty had a difficult syntax to learn. In the end, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/smarty-the-templating-system-that-came-from-hell?replies=6#post-22474&quot;&gt;it was rejected for being too complicated&lt;/a&gt;. What WordPress needed was a system as easy to use as the software itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While templating system discussions continued, WordPress users got creative with CSS stylesheets. To make switching designs easy, Alex King wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/20/wordpress-css-style-switcher&quot;&gt;CSS Style Switcher&lt;/a&gt; hack, which came with three CSS stylesheets. Not everyone who had a WordPress blog wanted to create their own stylesheet, and many didn’t know how. Users needed a pool of stylesheets to choose from. To grow the number of stylesheets available, Alex ran a WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition&quot;&gt;CSS Style competition&lt;/a&gt;. Prizes, donated by members of the community, were offered for the top three stylesheets; &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;70&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo separator=&quot;true&quot;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;70,&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.8388800000000001em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mpunct&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;35, and $10, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a resource similar to the popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://csszengarden.com&quot;&gt;CSS Zen Garden&lt;/a&gt; was the secondary aim of the stylesheet competition. Just as the CSS Zen Garden showed off CSS&apos; flexibility, a CSS stylesheet repository would show off WordPress&apos; flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition created buzz in the community. In total, there were 38 submissions. Naoko Takano won the first competition with her entry, Pink Lillies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/12/pink-lillies.png&quot; alt=&quot;Naoko Takano&apos;s Pink Lillies theme&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Lillies design, by Naoko Takano&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition successfully widened the pool of available stylesheets, increasing the number from seven to 45. On his website, Alex launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles/sample.php?wpstyle=pink_lilies&quot;&gt;style browser to allow visitors to view the different stylesheets&lt;/a&gt;. The competition &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition&quot;&gt;ran again in 2005&lt;/a&gt;, this time receiving more than a hundred submissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the second competition, the theme system was in place and designers had more tools to design and build their theme. Alex’s experience in the second competition, however, foreshadowed problems that would dog the community in later years. In hosting 138 themes on his site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2005/03/28/theme-competition&quot;&gt;Alex had to review all of the code&lt;/a&gt; to make sure there was nothing malicious, and to ensure that each theme used coding best practices. He decided not to host the competition again in 2006 due to the sheer amount of work it required. WordPress’ growth meant there would be even more submissions, far too many for one person to review. This problem persisted as the project grew: how does one balance a low barrier to entry with achieving good code quality, particularly in third-party plugins and themes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the 2005 competition showed off the flexibility of the brand new theme system, which appeared in February 2005, in WordPress 1.5. [fn^1] In the end, the theme system was built using PHP, which is a templating language itself, after all. Using a PHP template tag system was fast and easy, particularly for WordPress developers and designers who were learning PHP. It was &quot;cheap and easy, and well-known and portable,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_05_15_Boren1.html#L101&quot;&gt;says Ryan&lt;/a&gt;. The theme system breaks a theme down into its component parts -- header, footer, and sidebar, for example. Each part is an individual file that a designer can customize. Designers use template tags to call different elements to display on the front end. This bundle of files is a WordPress theme. A native WordPress theme system, as opposed to a templating system such as Smarty, meant that designers could design and build themes without learning an entirely new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundled with WordPress 1.5 was a new default theme -- an adapted version of Michael Heilemann’s Kubrick. While some welcomed the new theme, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20041016090654/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2004/08/22/kubrick-vs-wordpress/&quot;&gt;others were unhappy that it was chosen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Kubrick Theme&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/12/kubrick.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kubrick Theme, which was WordPress&apos; default theme until 2010&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with Kubrick was that it contained images; if a user wanted to change their theme they had to use an external image editor. Some felt that users should not be expected to download additional software just to change their site’s design. Others thought Kubrick too complex; it had .htaccess issues, and that other (better) default theme choices existed. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-using-kubrick-on-13-is-a-mistake&quot;&gt;thread on the forums&lt;/a&gt; reached five pages with substantial flaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of fires ignite quickly in bazaar-style development. They can get out of hand as people take their opinions to blogs and social media. As with many debates in free software communities, the Kubrick debate burned ferociously for a short time before fizzling out. But the brief outbreak portended later debates about WordPress themes. There’s something about themes that ignites passions more than other aspects of WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, by the release of WordPress 1.5, the software had two elements that define the project and the community: themes and plugins. These two improvements transformed WordPress from stand-alone software into an extensible platform. Extensibility creates the right conditions for an ecosystem to flourish. If a product is solid and attracts users, then developers will follow, extending the software and building tools for it. The theme and plugin systems made this possible, in both features and design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[fn^1] WordPress versions were skipped between 1.2 and 1.5. This was due to the length of time between the two releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;13. Development in a Funnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following WordPress 1.5, the software development process changed, precipitated by a version control system shift &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2005-February/004078.html&quot;&gt;from CVS to a more modern version control system, Subversion (SVN)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The most active contributors at that time were Ryan and Matt, and when the move was made, none of the other original developers had their commit access renewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A committer is someone who can use the commit command to make changes to the group’s central repository. The number of people who can do this on a project varies, with projects deciding on the number of committers depending on their own structure and philosophies. The question of who should have commit access to the WordPress repository comes up again and again. There are regular threads requesting that more people be given commit access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move from CVS to Subversion marked a long period in which WordPress development operated through a funnel. Contributors created a patch, uploaded it to Mosquito (and later trac), &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it was reviewed by one of the committers who committed the code to the main repository. Over time, the funnel narrowed as Matt’s focus went elsewhere and Ryan drove development. This &quot;funnel&quot; development style has advantages and disadvantages, and it was frequently the subject of discussion among the community, particularly on wp-hackers. The advantage of a funnelling process is that disagreements about code happen on the mailing list, before a change lands in the repository. The disadvantage is that one person has to review every patch, which frustrates developers waiting for their patches to be committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As WordPress began to take shape as a recognized free software project, with a defined development process and proper developer infrastructure, Ryan’s previous experience guided many of these changes. WordPress differed in that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/content/23-how-patches-get-kernel&quot;&gt;Linux has only one committer&lt;/a&gt; -- project founder Linus Torvalds -- whereas WordPress had two in Matt and Ryan. Over the years this opened up to more and more committers. The other difference is that Linux has &quot;maintainers&quot; who maintain different subsystems before pushing patches upstream. This means that Torvalds doesn’t review the thousands of patches that go into the kernel. He reviews a fraction of them and delegates review to trusted subsystem maintainers. Although WordPress in the future would move toward component maintainers, it never followed Linux in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons that people request commit access: to speed up development, to prevent situations in which patches wait months for a review, to acknowledge the contributions of project regulars, to create a more egalitarian project structure. Adding a new committer to a project became a major decision and the project’s approach changed dramatically from the wild west days of coding in WordPress 0.7. When the project started, anyone who demonstrated some technical expertise and minimal dedication got commit access. All of those developers could commit code to the repository whenever they wanted. But as the project and the number of users grew, it became more important to have some sort of filtering mechanism. A committer is the filter through which the code is passed. When someone is given commit access to the repository, it demonstrates a level of trust. It signifies that a contributor is trusted to know which code should make it into WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#committers&quot;&gt;Karl Fogel describes committers as&lt;/a&gt; “the only formally distinct class of people found in all open source projects.” “Committers are an unavoidable concession to discrimination in a system which is otherwise as non-discriminatory as possible,” he writes. As much as one tries to maintain that commit is a functional role, commit access is a symbol of trust, both in terms of coding skills and in a person’s adherence to the project’s core beliefs and ethos. A power dynamic exists between those who have commit access and those who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committers provide quality control. To decide who to give commit access to, a project maintainer has to first find people who not only write good code, but who are good at reviewing other people’s code. This means being good at recognizing places in which code can be improved and providing constructive feedback. But there are other social skills that go along with being a committer. For one, the person needs to adhere to a project’s ideals. Within WordPress, this means being fully committed to the project’s user-first approach. Committers also need to “&lt;a href=&quot;http://producingoss.com/en/committers.html#choosing-committers&quot;&gt;play well in the sandbox&lt;/a&gt;.” Someone may write flawless code, but if they are unable to work with others they aren’t going to make a wonderful committer. It’s important to make good choices about who gets commit access because once it&apos;s been given, it&apos;s difficult to take away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to avoid an “us and them” mentality in which committers have higher status than everyone else, the WordPress project had only two committers. This meant that everyone was subject to the same review process and the same rules. Opening it up to more people may have created dissatisfaction among those who didn’t have commit access. But by not opening it up at all, developers who felt that they could never progress within the current project structure became frustrated. So few committers in a growing project also meant a mounting number of patches that languished on trac as they awaited review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a perennial tug-of-war between those who contribute to the project and those who maintain it, and even among the project leaders themselves. Who gets commit access and for how long? What sort of status is attached to commit? Should only lead developers be committers? What is a &quot;lead developer&quot; anyway? Over the coming years these questions play out at various stages in the project’s development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;14. A New Logo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development progressed, WordPress’ design and branding took shape. Some of the first lengthy discussions about WordPress&apos; look and feel happened on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/&quot;&gt;wp-design mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. This was a private mailing list of designers and developers interested in crafting WordPress’ aesthetic. Michael Heilemann (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/michael&quot;&gt;michael&lt;/a&gt;), Khaled Abou Alfa (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/khaled&quot;&gt;khaled&lt;/a&gt;), Joen Asmussen (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/joen&quot;&gt;joen&lt;/a&gt;), Chris Davis (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisjdavis&quot;&gt;chrisjdavis&lt;/a&gt;), Joshua Sigar (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/alphaoide&quot;&gt;alphaoide&lt;/a&gt;), and Matt composed the main group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first focused design discussion was about WordPress’ logo. Matt designed the original logo; it was simply the word &quot;WordPress&quot; in the Dante font:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/wp-logo-old.png&quot; alt=&quot;Original WordPress logo&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original WordPress logo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the project was so small, community members had fun on the homepage, riffing on the logo with versions for seasonal holidays, birthdays, and other events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/wp-logo-stpatty.gif&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress St Patricks Day Logo&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/wp-logo-valentine.gif&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Valentines Day Logo&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/wp-logo-happy-dougal.png&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Happy Birthday Dougal Logo&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/wp-logo-calvin.gif&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Calvin Logo&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logos that were created for WordPress.org for special occasions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, WordPress needed a professional logo. Usage was growing and WordPress needed a logo that properly represented it. As a free software project, the community was the first place to look for a logo. Community suggestions were solicited. A mixed set of results came back, which were shared with the wp-design group for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000163.html&quot;&gt;first suggestions&lt;/a&gt; were from Andreas Kwiatkowski:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_03_wordpress-logo-proposal_kwiatkowski_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kwiatkowski logo suggestion 1 =600x&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_03_wordpress-logo-proposal_kwiatkowski_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kwiatkowski logo suggestion 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WordPress logo suggestions from Andreas Kwiatkowski.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000171.html&quot;&gt;second batch came&lt;/a&gt; from Denis Radenkovic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_03_wordpress-logo-proposal_radenkovic_sample.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radenkovic heart logo&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WordPress logo suggestions from Denis Radenkovic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logo feedback was mostly lukewarm, though &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000175.html&quot;&gt;some of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000173.html&quot;&gt;designers&lt;/a&gt; liked Radenkovic&apos;s heart logos, describing them as &quot;instantly recognizable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart logo was iterated on, with another version posted to the design mailing list: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_05_wordpress-logo-proposal_asmussen_sample.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Asmussen first design&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joen Asmussen&apos;s iteration of the heart logo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A version of the admin screen with it in situ was produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_05_wordpress-logo-proposal_asmussen_admin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Asmussen admin design&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joen Asmussen&apos;s admin design with the heart logo in situ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community members weren&apos;t the only ones tackling the logo. In March, Matt met &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasonsantamaria.com/&quot;&gt;Jason Santa Maria&lt;/a&gt; at South by South West and asked him to try redesigning the WordPress logo. They shared ideas about what they thought the logo should be: &quot;the things that kept coming up were not only the idea of publishing but the idea of having a personal journal and a personal thing that might have some sort of tactile overtones,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_01_22_Santa_Maria.html#L7)&quot;&gt;Jason says&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We were making links to things like letterpress and journaling and any sort of older representations of what it meant to publish something in a physical form.&quot; In April 2005, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000182.html&quot;&gt;some of the early versions were shared&lt;/a&gt; with the wp-design group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_04_wordpress-logo-proposal-santa-maria1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Santa Maria, first logo versions&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first logo ideas sketched by Jason Santa Maria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of responses from the designers on the mailing list: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000194.html&quot;&gt;a little too aristocratic&lt;/a&gt;&quot; was one of the comments. The designers &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000185.html&quot;&gt;felt that Denis Radenkovic&apos;s design&lt;/a&gt; was more in line with WordPress&apos; brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More designs were posted to the group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_04_wordpress-logo-proposal-santa-maria2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Santa Maria, logo 2&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_04_wordpress-logo-proposal-santa-maria3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Santa Maria, logo 3&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further iterations on the logo design from Jason Santa Maria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The members of the mailing list didn’t seem to agree on WordPress’ aesthetic. On one hand, there were people who felt that the logo should represent warmth and community, and on the other hand, something classic and elegant. To reach a consensus, discussions happened offline. Khaled &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000192.html&quot;&gt;reported back&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;WordPress is meant to be the Jaguar or Aston Martin of Blogging tools. [...] that line sets the stage for what the design of the branding should be. Elegance, polished, and impecably [sic] designed is where we should be aiming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The logo was finally decided on May 15th, when Matt sent an email to the mailing list with the subject &quot;I think this is it.&quot; Matt&apos;s message contained just one image:
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/14/2005_04_wordpress-logo-proposal-santa-maria-final.gif&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final design for the WordPress logo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major change to the logo, other than the new typeface, was the mark. The creation of a mark gave WordPress a stand-alone element of the logo which, over time, would be recognizable even without the word beside it. This could and would be used in icons, branding, and t-shirts. It’s become instantly recognizable, helped by its appearance on WordCamp t-shirts the world over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15. WordPress Incorporated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the number of people using WordPress grew steadily, more and more needed to get done. Matt took a job at CNET, which allowed him to work on WordPress alongside his day job. Ryan was working at Cisco, often 60 or 80 hours a week; he would come home to work on his hobby, WordPress. Apart from time spent on the project, there are all sorts of associated costs that come with running a growing project. Server costs, for example, that increase as the project&apos;s popularity grows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of March 2005, WordPress 1.5 had seen 50,000 downloads. Just three weeks later, the number doubled to 100,000. To celebrate the landmark, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2005/03/fifty-thousand/&quot;&gt;100K party in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. On March 22, a group of WordPressers got together at the Odeon Bar in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonas Luster (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/jluster/&quot;&gt;jluster&lt;/a&gt;) was at the party. Jonas was an employee at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CollabNet&quot;&gt;Collabnet&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind Subversion. He and Matt had been talking about what a company built around free software should look like. Matt had an idea for an organization called Automattic: an umbrella company that would include several WordPress organizations. The first of these was WordPress Incorporated. At the party, Matt asked Jonas if he&apos;d like to be involved. Jonas said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterward, Matt jumped on stage to announce WordPress Inc. -- with Jonas Luster as employee number one. By the following morning, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfist.com/2005/03/22/wordpress_incorporated.php&quot;&gt;couple of blogs&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=&quot;http://laughingsquid.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-wordpress-inc/&quot;&gt;covered the announcement&lt;/a&gt;. A few days later, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2005/03/wordpress-world-tour/&quot;&gt;Matt went on holiday&lt;/a&gt; leaving WordPress&apos; very first employee in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the party was going on, trouble was brewing. In February, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-wordpress-articles?replies=6&quot;&gt;user posted to the WordPress.org support forums&lt;/a&gt; asking about hundreds of articles hosted at wordpress.org/articles/. The articles were about everything from credit and healthcare to web hosting. The thread was closed by a forum moderator. Blogger Andy Baio discovered the thread. He contacted Matt to ask about what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WordPress/book/master/Resources/images/15/wp_org_spam.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google search results that show the articles hosted on WordPress.org. (Google and the Google logo are registered trademarks of Google Inc., used with permission.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt explained to Andy that he was being paid by a company called Hot Nacho to host the articles on WordPress.org and that he was using the money to cover WordPress&apos; costs. &quot;The /articles thing isn&apos;t something I want to do long-term,&quot; he told Andy, &quot;but if it can help bootstrap something nice for the community, I&apos;m willing to let it run for a little while.&quot; In addition to responding to Andy, Matt re-opened the support forum thread and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-wordpress-articles?replies=6#post-160502&quot;&gt;left a response&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The content in /articles is essentially advertising by a third party that we host for a flat fee. I&apos;m not sure if we&apos;re going to continue it much longer, but we&apos;re committed to this month at least, it was basically an experiment. However around the beginning of Feburary [sic] donations were going down as expenses were ramping up, so it seemed like a good way to cover everything. The adsense on those pages is not ours and I have no idea what they get on it, we just get a flat fee. The money is used just like donations but more specifically it&apos;s been going to the business/trademark expenses so it&apos;s not entirely out of my pocket anymore.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 30, while Matt was in Italy, Andy &lt;a href=&quot;http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/&quot;&gt;published an article about it on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. The reaction from bloggers was bad: no matter what Matt&apos;s intentions, people saw the articles as a shady SEO tactic. A free software project should know better than to work with article spammers. Not only was WordPress.org hosting the spammy articles, CSS had been used &lt;a href=&quot;http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/#comment-18433&quot;&gt;to cloak them&lt;/a&gt;. If everything was above board, why not do it out in the open? The articles also had an influence on WordPress.org’s hosts, TextDrive, who hosted WordPress for free on a server along with apps such as Ruby on Rails. Their servers were overloaded with hits from the links in the Hot Nacho articles.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Matt out of town, Jonas dealt with the fallout from Andy Baio&apos;s article on Waxy.org. It wasn&apos;t clear where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/#comment-18519&quot;&gt;line between WordPress.org and WordPress Inc. lay&lt;/a&gt;, but Jonas was the only official-sounding person. He fielded the tech community&apos;s ire and spent the next few days putting out fires. Jonas posted on his blog asking for calm, and that Matt be given the benefit of the doubt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forevergeek.com/2005/03/wordpress_making_money_the_wrong_way/&quot;&gt;The Hot Nacho articles were perceived&lt;/a&gt; as the first move by WordPress Inc. to make money -- an indication that Matt and Jonas were&apos;t going to monetize WordPress in an ethical manner. Jonas stressed that the articles had nothing to do with WordPress Inc., but since it wasn’t clear at that time what WordPress Inc. actually was, people naturally lumped them together. By the next day, Andy had updated his post to report that WordPress&apos; PageRank had dropped to 0/0. WordPress.org had been removed from Google&apos;s search engine results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story escalated as major tech resources like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/31/cnet_weblog_keyword_scam/&quot;&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/story/05/03/31/196220/wordpress-banned-by-google-for-spamming&quot;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/03/4759-2/&quot;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt; picked it up. On March 31, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/&quot;&gt;Matt posted briefly on his blog&lt;/a&gt; to say that he had just learned of what had happened and that he would get online to address the questions as soon as possible. The comments are littered with messages of support from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/#comment-18670&quot;&gt;people who would later be central to the project&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/#comment-18673&quot;&gt;from Matt&apos;s rival&lt;/a&gt;. Matt also received &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/support-matt-mullweg?replies=23&quot;&gt;support on WordPress&apos; support forums&lt;/a&gt;.

On April 1, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2005/04/a-response/&quot;&gt;Matt issued a full response&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Matt explains that he was struggling to find a way to support the free software project, and that he felt that his options were limited:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To thrive as an independent project WordPress needs to be self-sufficient. There are several avenues this could go, all of which I&apos;ve given a lot of thought to. One route that would be very easy to go in today&apos;s environment is to take VC funding for a few million and build a big company, fast. Another way would be to be absorbed by an already big company. I don&apos;t think either is the best route for the long-term health of the community. (None of these are hypothetical, they&apos;ve all come up before.) There are a number of things the software could do to nag people for donations, but I&apos;m very hesitant to do anything that degrades the user experience. Finally we could use the blessing and burden of the traffic to wordpress.org to create a sustainable stream of income that can fund WP activities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting the articles on WordPress.org attempted to mitigate the free software project&apos;s costs. For many people, Matt&apos;s response satisfied their concerns and questions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20050922005353/http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/04/01/there-is-communicationand-then-theres-not/&quot;&gt;But for others, it wasn&apos;t enough&lt;/a&gt;. If a free software project has to resort to turning its highly ranking website into a link farm, what is the future viability of that project? Aren’t there other ways to support it? Matt had been at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2005/02/at-spam-summit/&quot;&gt;web spam summit&lt;/a&gt; in February, which had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000288.html&quot;&gt;specifically addressed&lt;/a&gt; &quot;comment spam, link spam, TrackBack spam, tag spam, and fake weblogs.&quot; Hadn&apos;t he, at that point, realized that there might be something dubious?		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most storms on the internet, once the articles were removed and Matt had apologized, the anger subsided. It did, however, have a lasting influence. The experience &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_17_Mullenweg.html#L65&quot;&gt;changed Matt&apos;s thinking about spam&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of viewing it purely as something that appears in an email inbox, he now saw it as web spam, which can quickly pollute the web. This influenced his thinking when developing Akismet, Automattic&apos;s anti-spam plugin. And while Matt had learned a harsh lesson about ethical ways to make money on the web, it would return to haunt him again and again. Any time WordPress.org clamped down on search engine optimization tactics, in themes for example, irate community members would bring up Hot Nacho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonas&apos; first few weeks at WordPress Inc. got off to an explosive start, and over the next few months he continued to work unpaid as WordPress Inc.&apos;s only employee. He got in touch with major web hosts and created partnerships so that WordPress.org could make money by recommending hosting companies. He met with venture capitalists to talk about where WordPress was going.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/August/August03RawLog&quot;&gt;IRC Meetup in August 2005&lt;/a&gt;, Matt discussed some of the ways he wanted to see the project supported. Instead of fundraising, he wanted to see a company that could generate revenue. He said that &quot;the goal, eventually, is for it to be the biggest contributor someday, supporting community members to work on WP full-time.&quot; To protect the project from company liabilities, donations would be kept separate. This would ensure that if the company was sold, the project would be safe. In this chat, the &quot;inc.&quot; that Matt refers to isn&apos;t WordPress Inc., but the as-yet-unannounced Automattic. When asked about employees, he said that the only one was Donncha, with Ryan Boren planned for the future. WordPress Inc. itself petered out, disappearing with much less fanfare than when it arrived. There wasn&apos;t money available in WordPress Inc. to pay Jonas a salary, especially when Matt was using his own salary from his job at CNET to pay Donncha to work on WordPress.com.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wider community was &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20110816084138/http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/008169.php&quot;&gt;confused about what had happened with WordPress Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, especially those who had watched Matt announce the company&apos;s launch on stage. In response, Matt &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Inc_Story&quot;&gt;posted a page on the WordPress Codex&lt;/a&gt;, explaining what had happened:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the WordPress 100k party in March 2005, I talked about the formation of a &quot;WordPress Inc.&quot; with Jonas Luster as the first employee. That never really got off the ground, I continued my job at CNET and Jonas (who I couldn&apos;t afford to pay a salary) ended up going to work for Technorati. It wasn&apos;t even planned to be announced at the party (since it wasn&apos;t clear logistically how it would happen) but everyone was really excited about it and I had an extra G&amp;amp;T (or two), we all got carried away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first movement toward making money to support WordPress was more of a stumble than a step. It did produce some important lessons, however, about how to run a business alongside a free software project. In any attempt to run a business based on a free software project, the company is beholden to two players: the company itself and the community. In terms of the company, investors have to be kept happy and employees have to be looked after. The company needs to make money. On the other hand, it is the community that is invested in growing the free software project, and assuring its integrity and independence. Walking the line between the two can be difficult for any community member, but particularly for a project founder or lead who has multiple reasons for securing the future of both.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16. WordPress.com&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As WordPress Incorporated fizzled, Matt pitched a WordPress-based blogging network to his employers at CNET. Many major internet companies had blogging networks including Google, Blogger, Yahoo 360, and Microsoft Spaces. CNET also owned several domains, like online.com, that seemed perfect for a blogging network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNET decided against it, but the idea didn’t disappear. Matt decided to build a blogging network himself. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he needed the WordPress.com domain name. At the time, it was owned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendomain.org/&quot;&gt;Open Domain&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that registered domains and gave projects permission to use them in return for acknowledgement. It was unclear whether Open Domain was &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive09.linux.com/feature/140576&quot;&gt;squatting on domains, or genuinely trying to help free software communities&lt;/a&gt;. (They&apos;d also registered Drupal.com, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://buytaert.net/drupal-com&quot;&gt;donated it to Drupal without incident&lt;/a&gt;). The WordPress community was understandably perturbed by the idea of someone squatting on WordPress.com. Owning the domain was key; there was little security in a blogging network without control of its own name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of wrangling, Matt acquired the WordPress.com domain and work began. Donncha, as the developer of WPMU, was a perfect candidate -- and fortuitously, was looking for new work opportunities. When Matt emailed the WordPress security mailing list to see if anyone was interested, Donncha got in touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new WordPress.com ran WPMU trunk. Development was fast. Donncha worked on two servers and live-edited code. Without users to worry about, he moved quickly. He improved user-focused functionality and built network administration tools. The WPMU community helped, submitting patches to clean up admin screens. Features like domain mapping and tags, which didn’t sit well in WPMU, went into plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Skelton (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/skeltoac&quot;&gt;skeltoac&lt;/a&gt;) was WordPress.com&apos;s second employee -- and first acquisition. Andy had developed Blogs of the Day, a self-hosted stats plugin that produced a list of each day&apos;s most popular blogs. After meeting him in Seattle, Matt brought Andy on board to create a stats plugin for WordPress.com based on Blogs of the Day which, for a number of years, was featured on WordPress.com&apos;s home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com opened to signups in August 2005, &lt;a href=&quot;http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/08/15/invites/&quot;&gt;by invitation only&lt;/a&gt;, to control user growth on untested servers. Many who were involved with the WordPress project got WordPress.com blogs, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://lorelle.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Lorelle VanFossen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mark.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Mark Riley&lt;/a&gt;. Every new WordPress.com member also got one invite to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People could also join by downloading the Flock browser, a browser with built-in social networking tools. “I thought Flock was the future,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_17_Mullenweg.html#L143&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;. “First we did invites, and then we thought well, we’ll allow you to bypass an invite if you’re using Flock because then we’ll know that you’re kind of a social, in-the-know person.” Flock integrated with WordPress.com, and users could use it to post straight to their blogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these measures -- invites and Flock -- allowed WordPress.com to grow in a steady and sustainable way. Putting in sign-up barriers controlled the flow of people and helped ensure scalability. Nevertheless, demand quickly outstripped supply; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/08/23/wordpresscom-invite-on-ebay-2/&quot;&gt;one invite even landed on eBay&lt;/a&gt;.
The influx of new bloggers also brought demands for support. Without a clear distinction between WordPress.com and WordPress.org, many bloggers made their way to the WordPress.org forums looking for help. This caused some discontent among WordPress.org forum volunteers, who felt that they were doing free work for a service that would eventually become commercial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first attempt at WordPress.com-specific support was an email address. Developers responded to the messages, diverting their attention from writing code. “I found that I would spend half my day replying to users,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_08_OCaoimh.html#L48&quot;&gt;recalls Donncha&lt;/a&gt; “and then being completely wrecked in that your mind is completely taken off programming new features, or improving things, fixing bugs, just because this whole thing is so tiring.” Plan B was a mailing list, followed by WordPress.com-specific community support forums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, support moved to a ticketing system led by Mark Riley, a veteran of the WordPress.org support forums who became WordPress.com&apos;s sixth full-time employee. For a long time, he was solely responsible for support, closing nearly 50,000 requests on his own. The next support person joined in 2008; today, WordPress.com users have a robust community on their own forums and a huge team of &quot;Happiness Engineers&quot; supporting them. (Although it&apos;s still not unusual for WordPress.com users to land on the WordPress.org forums.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a user-focused blogging platform like WordPress.com made sense in the context of the WordPress project:  WordPress has always been focused on its users, on people who might not understand the mechanics of a server, but still want a website. WordPress.com took this accessibility to the next level, letting people fill out a form to get a blog with the power of WordPress. Still, WordPress.com is a balancing act, trying to satisfy those who want a simple website builder, with those who want the flexibility and power of the core WordPress software, and providing a middle ground for people who want a website without building one from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a hosted service like WordPress.com needs a revenue stream to pay for server costs, run the software, provide support, and pay staff. The free software project, with its haphazard donations and income from hosting companies, couldn&apos;t maintain such a network on a wide scale. WordPress.com needed a supporting business focused on WordPress’ main audience: software users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the business end was coming together around the developers who had built WordPress.com, Matt was working on another product that would influence the WordPress community, an anti-spam plugin called Akismet. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;17. Akismet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online spam is the old annoyance of unsolicited mail, writ large and filling digital inboxes worldwide. Initially limited to email, it quickly became a blog issue: blog comment forms allow anyone to enter data, and any opportunity for data entry is a doorway for spam. WordPress, like every other blogging platform, is susceptible. Developers were working on anti-spam solutions as early as 2005, with plugins like Spam Karma and Bad Behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt was also working on an anti-spam solution. His first attempt was a JavaScript-based plugin that modified the comment form to hide fields. Spammers downloaded it, picked it apart, and learned to bypass it within hours of launch. This is a common pitfall for anti-spam plugins; any widely-adopted plugin quickly attracts spammer attention, and a work-around soon follows. Regrouping, he tried a new tactic: crowd-sourced spam reporting. In late 2005 &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2005/10/akismet-stops-spam/&quot;&gt;Matt launched the Akismet plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. Akismet -- short for &quot;Automattic kismet&quot; -- used the power of the community to create a plugin that evolved alongside spammer tactics. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time someone comments on a website running Akismet, Akismet checks the comment against all the spam in its database. If the comment is identified as spam, it&apos;s deleted. When spam comments inevitably get through, a site owner can mark them as spam to remove them and add them to the database. This means that as all the site owners using Akismet report spam, the pool of spam comments in the database grows, making Akismet more and more effective over time. “It’s like all the kids on the playground ganging up against a bully.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_17_Mullenweg.html#L97&quot;&gt;says Matt&lt;/a&gt;, “Collectively we all have the data and the information to stop spammers, certainly before they’re able to have a big impact.”  		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2005, the wp-hackers mailing list discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003162.html&quot;&gt;plugins to bundle with WordPress core&lt;/a&gt;, and an anti-spam solution topped the wish list. Akismet came up, though &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003177.html&quot;&gt;not everyone was comfortable using a plugin with a commercial element&lt;/a&gt;; Akismet is only free for non-commercial use. (Payment is based on an honor system that asks commercial users to self-report.) Some questioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/October/October26RawLog&quot;&gt;Akismet&apos;s data collection and storage methods&lt;/a&gt;. Akismet had one other significant shortcoming: it required a WordPress.com account, and WordPress.com hadn’t officially launched. Using Akismet meant using WordPress.com, which meant finagling an invitation or downloading the Flock browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the pushback, there was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003189.html&quot;&gt;equal amount of support&lt;/a&gt;. Some didn&apos;t find the pay-what-you-want system jarring, arguing that Akismet has server costs to cover. When WordPress 2.0 beta came out that month, it was bundled with Akismet. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2005/11/wordpresscom-open/&quot;&gt;WordPress.com opened to the public&lt;/a&gt; two days later, making both services available to anyone.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns that a money-making plugin ships with WordPress continue. Discussions about Akismet surface perennially in the community, including among core developers and at core team meetups. &quot;It seems an unfair advantage (for Automattic) and it cuts against WordPress&apos; goal of openness,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_22_Jaquith.html#L186&quot;&gt;says Mark Jaquith&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/MarkJaquith&quot;&gt;MarkJaquith&lt;/a&gt;). &quot;That being said, spam is still a huge problem and Akismet is still the leading product, even though there are now alternatives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public nature of WordPress development makes it difficult to develop a widely-adopted anti-spam tool. Dealing with spam via a service means that the plugin code itself can be open source, while the algorithms for identifying spam remain private. While there are often discussions about recommending a selection of anti-spam options rather than bundling Akismet with WordPress core, this isn&apos;t yet viable. &quot;The moment we recommend five plugins,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_21_Nacin.html#L265&quot;&gt;says Andrew Nacin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/nacin&quot;&gt;nacin&lt;/a&gt;), &quot;the spammers will all target the other four that don’t have the ability to evolve and learn like Akismet does.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of spam highlights the challenging intersection between business and free software: including a freemium plugin with WordPress doesn&apos;t gel with the software&apos;s openness goals, but removing it would have a detrimental effect on users, contravening the project&apos;s user-first principles. Akismet is still bundled with core, and the debates continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18. Shuttle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people experimented with ways to make money with WordPress, design changes were underway in the interface. Between 2005 and 2006, the WordPress community organized the &quot;Shuttle&quot; project to overhaul WordPress&apos; admin screens. Their aim: to create a coherent, distinct look for WordPress by redesigning wp-admin, which had inherited its design from b2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group&apos;s aesthetic refresh reimagined and modernized wp-admin, iterating on the design without re-architecting the interface or adding new features. They started work in the wake of WordPress 1.5, which came out with a set of admin screens ripe for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/18/admin1_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 1.5, Strayhorn&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as dealing with spam revealed tensions in the development process, Shuttle&apos;s work highlighted a pressure point: squaring coherent design and free software development. Design decisions, which are usually highly subjective, seem not to lend themselves to a public process. To work effectively, Shuttle felt they needed to tweak their methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linus&apos;s Law, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html&quot;&gt;outlined by Eric Raymond&lt;/a&gt;, says that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.&quot; If there&apos;s a bug in the software, make the code available to many people; someone will see the solution. For an issue with a defined answer, this can speed progress considerably. With design so subjective in nature, however, Shuttle designers worried that an open process would lead to too many cooks in the kitchen, and that competing opinions would lead to stalemates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike WordPress&apos; core developers, the Shuttle group communicated via private mailing list, wp-design. This list was open, but list archives weren&apos;t public. To be involved, a contributor had to be added to the group, and the group had to agree to add the new member. Discussions among members indicate that they deliberately tried to keep the group limited. &quot;An open mailing list would become so much noise and so little signal so quickly that there would be no way we could move forward,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_18_Davis.html#L91&quot;&gt;recalls Chris Davis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group remained small, with three main designers -- Michael, Joen, and Khaled -- supported by coders responsible for realizing the design vision. The group sent designs around among themselves, offered feedback on one another&apos;s work, and iterated on the design. They focused on specific elements, mainly the Post screen (&lt;code&gt;post.php&lt;/code&gt;). Over the course of the project, twenty-eight versions circulated among this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/18/shuttlev8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shuttle version 8&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/18/shuttlev14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shuttle version 14&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/18/shuttlev21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shuttle version 21&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/18/shuttlev26.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shuttle version 26&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the design process continued, elements of Shuttle were implemented in WordPress. One of the earliest Shuttle designs increased the size of the title field in the &lt;code&gt;post.php&lt;/code&gt; edit screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WordPress 1.5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another iteration of the &lt;code&gt;post.php&lt;/code&gt; screen collapsed elements like post status, categories, and author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;WordPress 2.0 Pods&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/18/pods_wp_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When WordPress 2.0 shipped with Shuttle-inspired changes, the feedback wasn’t entirely positive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060203042213/http://www.molly.com/2006/01/05/wordpress-20-and-akismet/&quot;&gt;Molly Holzschlag wrote that&lt;/a&gt; &quot;what WP2.0 has gained in interface appeal it&apos;s lost in some practicality too.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2006-January/000559.html&quot;&gt;Piecemeal implementation of their vision&lt;/a&gt; kept the Shuttle group from creating a single, cohesive redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was beset by other problems. Despite the closed mailing list, progress stalled without a clear leader charged with the project&apos;s overall vision. When one skims the mailing list&apos;s archives today, it reads like a design-focused discussion forum rather than the communications of a focused team with a clear task. As the Shuttle team discovered, a group of independent designers, each with their own ideas, can trip up design work as surely as a mailing list full of hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took the group a long time to complete work. They discussed minor design elements like rounded corners and gradients for lengthy periods, rather than examining the fundamental needs and wants of WordPress users. &quot;I don’t know if we were cooperating enough on getting a unified feel and a unified understanding of everything before we tried to actually apply our ideas to the problem,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_06_Heilemann.html#L74&quot;&gt;says Michael&lt;/a&gt;. Besides that, the contributors had jobs that absorbed their time, so work happened in fits and starts. While the original plan was to complete the admin redesign within three months, by mid-April 2005, this slid to September. The team eventually &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2005-November/000502.html&quot;&gt;missed the deadline for WordPress 2.0&lt;/a&gt; in late 2005. The next deadline (for inclusion in WordPress 2.1, which itself never materialized) was the end of January, though it was March 2006 before a complete set of mockups arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then that Khaled sent out a comprehensive set of screenshots with his vision for the new WordPress admin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/18/shuttlefinal/Dashboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shuttle Dashboard&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/18/shuttlefinal/Write.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shuttle Write Screen&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the group loved the designs, and the developers began coding. Still, development dragged on. In mid-April, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2006-April/000721.html&quot;&gt;Michael Heilemann withdrew from the project&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he had to prioritize other commitments. The same month, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2006-April/000723.html&quot;&gt;Khaled asked&lt;/a&gt; whether Matt or Ryan would ever get around to implementing the design. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2006-April/000730.html&quot;&gt;The response&lt;/a&gt; placed the redesign as a medium priority. Changes would be iterative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 14 2006, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20061105004935/http://www.brokenkode.com/archives/shuttle-launched/&quot;&gt;Khaled posted a complete set of designs to his blog&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the Shuttle project to a close. He was still under the impression that the mockups would be implemented in due course. They never were. Khaled and other members of the group felt disenfranchised, and drifted away from the community. Chris Davis and Michael Heilemann made the switch from WordPress to the Habari project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest failure of the Shuttle project wasn&apos;t the designs or implementation, but the process itself. To avoid getting bogged down with too many opinions, the group closed itself off from the community -- which created a new set of problems. Isolated from the larger community, they lost touch with the development process. The project&apos;s closed nature limited opportunities for other enthusiastic designers to step in and move the work forward. For each person excited to see a spectacular WordPress redesign, there was another person resentful that a blessed group of designers was working privately on something the whole community had a stake in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the final emails on the wp-design mailing list, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-design/2006-May/000732.html&quot;&gt;Matt outlined&lt;/a&gt; some of the things that he learned about design-oriented free software projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Work should not be done in private&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Design by committee doesn&apos;t work, better to break up tasks and let individual people focus on one section&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Focus on lots of incremental changes, rather than giant redesigns (you end up in the same place, and probably sooner)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Document the process and decisions along the way&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Code concurrently with the designs (and iterate)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t hype it, expectations get out of control&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid scope creep of features into designs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Set a deadline and stick to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tenets influenced the relationship between WordPress design and development, helping future design projects avoid the difficulties faced by the Shuttle group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;19. Automattic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time to give WordPress.com and Akismet a parent. WordPress, like many free software projects, started as a script built in a hacker&apos;s spare time. As the community grew and more people adopted the software, the hacker realized it could be a business -- a for-profit venture, with dedicated employees and a company to cover costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, there weren&apos;t yet many businesses run alongside free software projects. Creating a company to house WordPress.com and Akismet would be a delicate balancing act to satisfy very different constituencies. The business is responsible to investors and employees, while the community of contributors has no stake in the business, but a huge stake in the project. Decisions come under scrutiny from both sides. As founder of the project and the company, Matt would be pulled in both directions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What companies based on free software and their foundational projects share is belief in the power of free, open source software. A WordPress.com company would offer a service and generate income while keeping the core software free and accessible. Making money would be but one aim, alongside popularizing free software for the benefit of society. It seemed to make sense for a business to spring up alongside WordPress, one that shared its commitment to the open web and to democratizing publishing, and that would help sustain the WordPress project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2005, as the memory of WordPress Inc. faded, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2005/12/automattic-beta/&quot;&gt;Automattic launched&lt;/a&gt; as a new home for WordPress.com and Akismet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automattic marked a new, but challenging, beginning for its employees, who had to balance the free project&apos;s aims with the company&apos;s commercial goals. It&apos;s a balance that has affected both WordPress and Automattic throughout their close histories. The business generates income and provides contributors and support to the project, while the project creates the software that is the foundation of the business. The business needs to grow in a non-destructive, sustainable way, allowing the project to grow, mature, and attract a diverse group of contributors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company launched with four employees: Donncha Ó Caiomh, the original developer of WordPress MU, worked on WordPress.com&apos;s infrastructure with Ryan Boren, Matt, and Andy Skelton. They left their jobs and put their faith in WordPress -- that it could grow beyond its roots as a small project into a platform that could sustain a blogging business. 		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2006, Toni Schneider joined as CEO (or &quot;adult supervision&quot; for the still only 19-year-old Matt). Toni was a developer and later CEO of OddPost, a startup that was acquired by Yahoo! and became the basis of Yahoo! mail. After setting up the Yahoo! Developer Network, Toni joined Automattic for a new challenge.

Toni had his first encounter with the power of open source while working on OddPost. OddPost didn&apos;t have a spam filter and needed one, and an open source project provided the solution. Paul Graham had introduced his idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html&quot;&gt;Bayesian spam filtering&lt;/a&gt;; he open-sourced the idea, and Toni&apos;s team implemented it at OddPost. &quot;It just showed me that this is a really powerful model,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_07_27_Schneider.html#L28&quot;&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was attracted to Automattic by the challenges of building a product around free software. WordPress already had brand recognition, but no one was yet making money from it. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/18/magazines/business2/startuptype/index.htm&quot;&gt;2006 interview he said&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;WordPress is an interesting new challenge because it&apos;s not like most startups, where the world still hasn&apos;t heard of you. WordPress is way past that stage. On the other hand, there is no business yet. Until Automattic came along, there was nobody working for it. It was all volunteers. So taking that product momentum and somehow turning that into a business will be really interesting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other aspects of the project attracted Toni: the product wasn&apos;t a central, proprietary service, it wasn&apos;t owned solely by anyone, but by all of the people involved, and it gave users a say and a stake in a way other hosted services didn&apos;t -- anyone can set up a WordPress blog. Unlike a service like Gmail or Facebook, WordPress is something you make your own. The idea of a new kind of company with a new kind of influence was too much to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automattic brought together free software development experience with Toni&apos;s business experience to build a company organized around three key principles: a distributed workforce, a rapid-release development model, and a user-centric focus. All ultimately trace their roots to principles of open source development that still underpin Automattic today.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed workforce seemed like the natural model. Contributors to a free software project come from all over the world, and collaborate online to build tools that suit their needs. Automattic&apos;s first four employees came from four different locations, and the company remains distributed, enabling it to hire people from all over the world based on their skills, not their location -- a global talent pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_07_27_Schneider.html#L16&quot;&gt;Toni recalls how&lt;/a&gt;, in Automattic&apos;s early days, people expected its commitment to a fully remote workforce to break down. It goes against traditional business wisdom, which keeps employees supervised, in one place, and focused on hours worked instead of output. The first few employees were experienced at working in a distributed environment; new employees who found it difficult didn&apos;t last. Automattic responded by refining its hiring methods, developing a hiring process in which potential employees do a trial, working on real projects in the distributed environment, to see if the company is the right fit for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rapid release model, in which developers constantly push small releases straight to the user, lets Automattic iterate quickly and improve constantly. The company eschews the traditional &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&quot;&gt;waterfall model&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; in which development follows a strict sequence involving specifications, design, construction, integration, testing, debugging, installation, and maintenance. At Automattic, developers break down features into small components, create patches for each component, and launch code incrementally -- and directly to bloggers. There are few roadblocks, and developers and designers push enhancements and new products to millions of users within a few seconds. &lt;a href=&quot;http://toni.org/2010/05/19/in-praise-of-continuous-deployment-the-wordpress-com-story/&quot;&gt;Continuous deployment&lt;/a&gt; means that by May 2010, Automattic had over 25,000 releases, an average of 16 a day. Rather than optimizing for perfection, the process optimizes for speed. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed workforce and rapid releases work for Automattic because the people who build its products have a direct connection to their customers, doing away with as many levels of mediation as possible. Every person in the company starts their Automattic career with three weeks of direct customer support, with one more week every year, giving each employee the opportunity to see how users interact with the products -- and where the weak spots are. Developers stay happy because they can constantly push new ideas right to customers. Customers stay happy because they&apos;re constantly getting new toys to play with, and the chance to share feedback that refines the product.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Automattic&apos;s launch, the bulk of new hires came from the free software project. Seven of the first ten employees were from the WordPress community, all with an intimate knowledge of developing and using the software. Automattic had a wealth of developers who were not just experienced, but passionate and committed, evidenced by the considerable volunteer time they&apos;d put into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start, Automattic was both exciting and contentious. It wasn’t obvious where Automattic&apos;s boundaries ended and the WordPress project&apos;s began. Matt and Ryan, the two developers who led WordPress, were both employees of Automattic, which appeared to make it an Automattic project. It was unclear even on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20051224051341/http://www.automattic.com/projects/&quot;&gt;original Automattic &quot;About&quot; page&lt;/a&gt;, which lists WordPress as an Automattic project. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confusion was compounded by the name of Automattic&apos;s blog network: WordPress.com. &quot;We gave the company this advantage of being able to call its service WordPress.com,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_07_27_Schneider.html#L40&quot;&gt;says Toni&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;It&apos;s been a curse and a blessing.&quot;  The mainstream tech press frequently describes Automattic as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2014/04/09/automattic-acquires-longreads/&quot;&gt;maker of WordPress&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; which does a disservice to the hundreds of contributors who aren&apos;t employed by Automattic. The WordPress.org support forums are littered with questions about WordPress.com from bloggers who don&apos;t understand the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Automattic puts millions of dollars into growing the WordPress brand, and a 2013 survey by WordPress hosting company WP Engine found that 30% of people had heard of WordPress. The name recognition increases the number of people opting for self-hosted WordPress sites rather than using Blogger, Tumblr, or other CMSs. There are many more people whose first exposure to WordPress is via WordPress.com, and a number of those eventually move to the self-hosted software. It&apos;s unlikely that the free software project would have had the money or the drive to do such extensive branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for-profit entity, Automattic experimented with different ways to make money. Creating an enterprise version was  considered, then scrapped -- since WordPress itself can run a blogging network like WordPress.com, producing an enterprise version didn’t make sense. Instead, it offered support services to enterprise-level clients. Prominent sites such as CNET, About.com, and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; were using WordPress, and other sites, such as Gigaom and TechCrunch, shifted to WordPress.com. Automattic initially courted these sites as a marketing strategy, thinking that nothing says &quot;WordPress can scale&quot; better than hosting big, high-traffic sites. Toni approached big websites to offer to host them on WordPress.com; early takers included Scobleizer and the Second Life blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automattic tested different subscription levels.

&lt;p&gt;Just because software is free doesn’t mean that services around that software have to be inexpensive. Companies are prepared to pay enterprise prices to ensure that their websites scale and stay online. Automattic, and other companies in the WordPress ecosystem, had to develop confidence, build up their pricing structure, and charge what they were worth.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;20. Growing Pains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2006, a Google survey found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2006/01/markup-survey/&quot;&gt;WordPress powered 0.8% of websites&lt;/a&gt;. The project was growing, and with greater adoption came greater tension. Growing pains are common for organizations -- especially in democratic communities where everyone has a voice -- and WordPress was not immune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and include formally taught developers, self-taught hackers, designers, people doing support and writing documentation, business owners, and bloggers. Contributor diversity is one of WordPress’ strengths, but wrangling so many viewpoints brings its own challenges. Disagreements coalesce around three broad issues: approaches to development and community building, styles of communication, and opinions on who the software is for (users or developers, for example, or users and business owners). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shuttle project was but one example. While the participants communicated privately, hoping to streamline and expedite the project, other WordPress contributors were concerned that work was going on behind closed doors and felt cut out of an important part of WordPress&apos; evolution. Co-founder Mike Little was one of those vexed by the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2005, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2639&quot;&gt;the Shuttle project updated the write screen&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new &quot;pods&quot; functionality that let users collapse parts of the screen. The changes were discussed only on the closed wp-design mailing list, precipitating a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001403.html&quot;&gt;long discussion on wp-hackers about openness&lt;/a&gt;. While Matt saw the commit as a starting point for discussion, others perceived it as a wholesale change made without communication. Many in the community felt that discussion should happen ahead of the commit, and that the community should have been informed about Shuttle&apos;s work. That was, after all, how free software projects should function.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog&quot;&gt;IRC discussions&lt;/a&gt; focused on Matt and Ryan as bottlenecks; only they had commit access, so all issues had to go through them. After lengthy conversations about how to make the process more open, Mark Jaquith and Sean Evans (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/morydd&quot;&gt;morydd&lt;/a&gt;) became &quot;bug gardeners,&quot; getting maximum trac privileges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inline documentation also generated heated debate. Many developers find exploring code a valuable learning tool, and there was strong community support for improving WordPress&apos; inline documentation. However, when Rich Bowen (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/drbacchus&quot;&gt;drbacchus&lt;/a&gt;) proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/004921.html&quot;&gt;documenting WordPress&apos; functions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/004926.html&quot;&gt;Carthik responded that&lt;/a&gt; inline documentation was frowned upon and would lead to bloat. Referring to a thread from May 2005, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-May/001114.html&quot;&gt;he offered&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Commenting is tricky. Some &quot;well-commented&quot; code I&apos;ve seen had a bunch  of lines of repetitive filler that &quot;documented&quot; what you could easily see by just looking at the code itself and doubled the size of the program. APIs should be documented religiously, but I think spending a ton of time on redundant comments for code only a few core hackers will ever look at will bloat the codebase and waste everyone&apos;s time. I also  believe that well-written code usually doesn&apos;t need comments unless it&apos;s doing some sort of voodoo or workaround.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich&apos;s initial proposal was the first volley in a lengthy back-and-forth about the best way to generate documentation from the code and the best inline documentation format. Matt argued that documentation shouldn&apos;t be auto-generated, pointing to the Codex as the best place for documentation, and the conversation &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/005088.html&quot;&gt;ultimately went nowhere&lt;/a&gt; despite &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005481.html&quot;&gt;ongoing community support&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2473&quot;&gt;Tickets went ignored&lt;/a&gt;, and Owen Winkler created his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-April/005534.html&quot;&gt;developer function reference&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Owen Winkler&apos;s Function Reference&quot; src=&quot;/wp-book/images/20/winkler_fn_ref.jpg&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Contributors from traditional coding backgrounds also butted heads with the self-taught hackers with whom WordPress is so closely identified, again over documentation. Many original WordPress developers were entirely self-taught. Michel&apos;s get-it-on-the-screen approach filtered through the project, sometimes at the expense of coding practices that more experienced developers took for granted -- like inline documentation, which some hackers considered superfluous to writing code, even bloat. It would take some time before it became standard practice in the WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems weren&apos;t limited to inline documentation. Mark Riley, one of WordPress&apos; longstanding forum moderators, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-forums/2006-March/001530.html&quot;&gt;pointed out in 2006&lt;/a&gt; the many ways that the WordPress Codex was failing users. &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Hardening_WordPress&amp;amp;oldid=16988&quot;&gt;The Codex recommended&lt;/a&gt; that users hide which version of WordPress they were running -- but the code itself contained a comment asking users to leave the information visible. Instructions were often confusing to less-technical WordPress users; a section on permissions  stated that &quot;All files should be owned by your user account, and should be writable by you. Any file that needs write access from WordPress should be group-owned by the user account used by the webserver,&quot; assuming that all users would know how to configure this. Because it was so easy for non-technical users to download and install WordPress, Mark argued, documentation should be written in clear, simple language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Release dates were another fault line. Almost every release cycle, Mark asked for the release date in advance so that he could ensure the support forums were properly staffed to handle the barrage of questions. Again and again, a release would arrive and surprise him. &quot;All I am trying -- and yet again completely failing -- to ask,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005310.html&quot;&gt;he pleads&lt;/a&gt; &quot;is that IF you want support for the product it would nice to at least let the forums know. You guys just don&apos;t see it do you? You really don&apos;t have a clue.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these issues highlights the tension between developers and non-developers on the project. WordPress encouraged people from all backgrounds to get involved, but developers weren’t always interested in supporting them. Many developers in the project were self taught, with the free software do-it-yourself attitude -- if they could teach themselves PHP, why couldn’t others? Mark Riley&apos;s mounting frustrations are clear on the wp-hackers mailing list, as he repeatedly posts questions from the support forums and requests help from developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges are unsurprising. When so many passionate people come together to work on a project, disagreement is inevitable. A free software project is a melting pot of people with different ideas, opinions, and backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom says that this approach to creating software shouldn’t work. But somehow it does. Despite the challenges, contributors stick around, new contributors constantly join, and the project grows. In the end, what matters isn’t the specifics of any one conflict, but how the community resolves them and moves on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;21. WordCamp 2006&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WordPress community has a long tradition of getting together to have fun and work on design and development in person. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2004/06/meetup-location/&quot;&gt;As early as June 2004&lt;/a&gt;, contributors were meeting in San Francisco to socialize &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/upgrade-party/&quot;&gt;and hold &quot;upgrade parties.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (Before the days of the one-click upgrade, users had to upgrade their sites individually using FTP; contributors gathered to help people upgrade, or to migrate from other platforms to WordPress.) A dedicated WordPress conference was the next step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt, along with Tantek Çelik, had helped organize an informal technology conference called BarCamp, a series of open, workshop-style events where attendees helped create the schedule. In July 2006, Matt announced that he would host a BarCamp-style event called &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/&quot;&gt;&quot;WordCamp&quot;&lt;/a&gt; later that summer in San Francisco. &quot;BarCamp-style&quot; is a code phrase for &apos;last minute,&apos;” &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/&quot;&gt;he joked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event -- which he announced without a venue or schedule -- would be on August 5th. More than 500 people from all over the world registered: Donncha flew in from Ireland, and Mark Riley from the UK. When WordCamp did get a venue, it was the Swedish American Hall, a Market Street house that served as headquarters for the Swedish Society of San Francsico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2006.wordcamp.org/schedule/&quot;&gt;WordCamp 2006&apos;s schedule&lt;/a&gt; reflects the project&apos;s concerns and its contributors&apos; passions. Mark Riley gave the first-ever workshop on getting involved with the WordPress community, now a staple talk at WordCamps. Andy Skelton presented on the widgets feature that he was working on for WordPress.com. Donncha spoke about WPMU, and Mark Jaquith explored &lt;a href=&quot;http://markjaquith.com/wordcamp/wordpress-versatility/&quot;&gt;WordPress as a CMS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/08/30/wordcamp-thoughts-late-to-the-game/&quot;&gt;one of the most-requested sessions&lt;/a&gt;. There were presentations about blogging and podcasting, and about journalism and monetizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordCamp San Francisco 2006 also saw Matt&apos;s inaugural &quot;State of the Word&quot; presentation, in which he &lt;a href=&quot;http://dan.hersam.com/2006/08/05/wordcamp-notes/&quot;&gt;focused on keeping the software simple&lt;/a&gt;, with streamlined installation and user-friendy theme and admin pages. He invited more people to contribute to documentation and support, highlighting Mark Riley&apos;s work, and discussed future updates in a Q&amp;#x26;A afterwards.  This WordPress year-in-review and &quot;coming soon&quot; talk has been a feature of every WordCamp San Francisco since (and in 2015, of the first-ever WordCamp US in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event, despite the short lead time, was a success and the first of what would be a global conference series. WordCamp returned to the Swedish American Hall in 2007, to be followed by WordCamp Beijing in September 2007 and additional WordCamps in Israel, Argentina, and Melbourne, Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirroring WordPress itself, these events are organized and supported by volunteers. There was no formal WordCamp program -- if someone wanted to organize an event, they did it. Like their BarCamp ancestors, they remained informal and user-led. It wasn’t until later, when the project had grown and the number of WordCamps across the world exploded, that WordCamps started to get some structure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;23. Trademarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trademarks411.com/marks/78826734&quot;&gt;March 2006, Automattic filed to register the WordPress trademark&lt;/a&gt;, and the competing interests of WordPress (the open-source project) and WordPress.com (the commercial enterprise) again clashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark registrations can be slow processes; a registrant has to demonstrate that they&apos;re proactively protecting that trademark. Toni Schneider spent many of his early years at Automattic doing just that. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_07_27_Schneider.html#L42&quot;&gt;It was a challenge, he says, to figure out&lt;/a&gt; “how can we make this a very open brand that lots of people can participate in but it doesn’t just turn into some mess that doesn’t mean anything in the marketplace because everybody just uses it in different ways.” The large ecosystem around WordPress can make it difficult for users to know who they’re dealing with: the official project? Automattic? A third-party developer or consultant? Avoiding trademark dilution was critical to ensure clarity.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any trademark can, over time, become generic: the meaning of the name morphs from identifying a specific thing to an entire class. The word “aspirin,” which is used as a general term for a class of medications in the United States, is actually a registered trademark of Bayer in 80 other countries. Office machinery company Xerox once ran an advertising campaign to dissuade people from using &quot;xerox&quot; as a verb. The onus is on the trademark owner to prevent their trademark from becoming generic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first meaningful attempt to protect the WordPress trademark sought to establish control over the domain. To successfully register a trademark, the owner has to enforce the trademark consistently. For WordPress this meant a domain policy -- a ban on using WordPress in top level domains for any sites other than WordPress.org and WordPress.com. Just before filing, WordPress.org created a domain policy requesting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060221154915/http://wordpress.org/about/domains/&quot;&gt;community members not use &quot;WordPress&quot; in their domains&lt;/a&gt;.

Once the application was submitted, Automattic began enforcing the domain guideline to protect the WordPress trademark. Many websites used WordPress in their domain names -- community websites, businesses selling WordPress products and services, WordPress fans, and more. There was confusion about what people could and couldn’t do. Could community members use WordPress in the title of their website? Was it okay in subdomains? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a comment thread on &lt;a href=&quot;http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/10/26/using-wordpress-in-your-domain-name-dont/&quot;&gt;Lorelle VanFossen&apos;s popular blog&lt;/a&gt;, community members wonder whether they can use the label &quot;on WordPress&quot; (as in &quot;Lorelle on WordPress&quot;) on their blogs. After lengthy discussion in the comments, Lorelle updated her post to add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;After many discussions with Matt and the WordPress Community and staff, it is official. It is a violation of trademark to use WordPress in your site’s domain name. You may use it in the title and in blog posts, however, please note that using WP or WordPress in the site title implies the site specializes in WordPress content. Don’t disappoint.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new policy influenced everything from community sites to businesses. International WordPress groups that had set up their own websites -- wordpress.dk, wordpress.fr, wordpress.pt -- were particularly affected. These community gathering points often had translated documentation, links for localized versions of the software, and support forums to make WordPress fully available to non-English speakers. To these groups, the domain policy felt like a top-down order rather than a community decision. For others who believed that the WordPress name and logo belonged to the project itself, domain restrictions seemed counter to the WordPress ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also affected was wordpress-arena.com, a site &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060422014104/http://www.arenawp.com/?p=10&quot;&gt;running a WordPress theme contest&lt;/a&gt;. After Alex King’s 2005 CSS competition, theme competitions became popular community events. The contests had clear community benefits, increasing the pool of themes, allowing developers to show off their skills, and pushing the boundaries of theme development. Although he enforced the domain guideline, Matt left the site a message of support, also noting that &quot;Unfortunately for every cool usage (like this competition, potentially) there are a dozen scammers and spammers misusing WordPress, selling spamming scripts or copies of WP itself.&quot;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later, official cease and desist letters went out to sites still using WordPress in their domains. Attention centered on two commercial websites, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060402224841/http://wordpressvideos.com/&quot;&gt;wordpressvideos.com&lt;/a&gt;, run by Brandon Hong, and Sherman Hu&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060705071350/http://www.wordpresstutorials.com/&quot;&gt;wordpresstutorials.com&lt;/a&gt;. Both were registered prior to WordPress’ trademark policy, and presented a unique trademarking challenge. The main test of trademark violation is “likelihood of confusion.” International community sites could easily be confused for the main WordPress project, as could sites selling plugins, themes, and other CMSs, but tutorials and books present a gray area. Similar sites in the Adobe community (photoshoptutorials.ws and photoshopessentials.com, for example) are not owned by Adobe, but are not seen as trademark violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherman Hu and Brandon Hong both received letters. As is often the case in the blogging world, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100217043501/http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html&quot;&gt;a blogger wrote about it&lt;/a&gt;: in his post, Andy Beard remarks on Automattic&apos;s tardiness in registering the trademark and preventing others from using it. He also defends the two sites being singled out. Both provided WordPress services and cultivated their own communities; they weren&apos;t, he felt, the &quot;spammy products&quot; that Matt thought they were. Besides, just a year earlier, there had been a link farm on WordPress.org.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others jumped to defend the two sites. Even those who supported Automattic&apos;s trademark position bristled when Matt branded the two sites as &quot;snake oil,” and Hu&apos;s customers and friends flocked to Beard&apos;s post to voice their support. Other prominent internet marketers, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyblogger.com/does-your-copy-look-spammy/&quot;&gt;copyblogger&apos;s Brian Clark&lt;/a&gt;, took issue with the fact that long sales letters were branded spammy and scammy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the sites came to an agreement with Automattic. Sherman agreed to add a trademark symbol beside every use of the word WordPress, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20061130162903/http://www.wordpresstutorials.com/?&quot;&gt;Hong&apos;s WordPress Tutorials site came out with a redesign&lt;/a&gt;. Sherman eventually shut WordPress Videos down in 2008, moving on to focus on his consulting business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Automattic has consistently enforced the WordPress trademark. While to many it appears that Automattic is motivated by commercial benefit, its involvement brings advantages as well; as commercial entity, it&apos;s able to put resources into enforcement that the free software project doesn&apos;t have.  Still, it would be several more years before all the WordPress trademark issues were resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;24. Habari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years in, the project included developers, support forum volunteers, documentarians, and others helping out. Many had been around since the early days, and while the project and software had grown and changed, some felt that the governance structure had not. A free software project can be run in many different ways. WordPress has always had a Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) structure: the final decision often rested with Matt, even if it was Ryan Boren who made and implemented most of the technical decisions. Some contributors, however, felt that the project could benefit from a committee structure, with a team of people driving the project’s direction and decision making. Others were unhappy with how Matt led the project, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://skippy.net/wordpress-less&quot;&gt;left&lt;/a&gt;. The first major fork of WordPress didn&apos;t involve software; it was within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the unhappy contributors met in September 2006, at the Ohio Linux Fest in Columbus. They had lunch together at a Buca di Beppo. Among the diners were four WordPress developers -- Owen Winkler (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/ringmaster&quot;&gt;ringmaster&lt;/a&gt;), Rich Bowen (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/drbacchus&quot;&gt;drbacchus&lt;/a&gt;), Scott Merrill (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/skippy&quot;&gt;Skippy&lt;/a&gt;), and Chris Davis (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisjdavis&quot;&gt;chrisjdavis&lt;/a&gt;). During lunch they talked about their grievances. The same story came up again and again -- patches were rejected because they didn’t fit the project&apos;s vision. The conversation kept returning to the possibility of setting up a new free-and-open-source (FOSS) project. By the time the meal ended, the developers had decided &lt;a href=&quot;http://matsu.wordpress.com/2007/01/08/witnessing-the-birth-of-an-open-source-project-habari/&quot;&gt;to stop talking and act&lt;/a&gt;: they would create a new blogging tool. A few weeks later at ApacheCon, they chose a name: Habari, which is Swahili for &quot;What&apos;s up?&quot; or &quot;What&apos;s the news?&quot; They created a governance structure and development ethos for the project, and started work in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habari launched in January 2007, and many of its founding principles are in direct opposition to those of the WordPress project. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070111191036/http://code.google.com/p/habari/wiki/Motivations&quot;&gt;Habari Motivations&lt;/a&gt; page addresses the issues that the founding developers objected to in the WordPress project -- and explains their different approach to running a free software project. It also highlights some problems that were afoot in the WordPress project three years after its launch. Every free software project -- indeed every group or community -- has its problems, especially as it becomes established. Tensions that were ignored during the initial heat of enthusiasm become entrenched, and as enthusiasm fades, those tensions surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governance style was one major issue. Many weren’t happy with the BDFL model, despite its prevalence in free software projects, from Linus Torvalds of Linux to Guido van Rossum of Python. A BDFL typically has final say about the project&apos;s direction and vision, but as a project grows, there are many people who wield influence and make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Bowen, one of the developers who was dissatisfied with how WordPress was run, came from the Apache project. Apache has a committee model. The committee comprises developers and non-developers, all of whom have a say in how the project runs. Unlike WordPress, which requires that commits be approved by the committer and/or the patch reviewer, commits in Apache require consensus. Habari launched with a committee structure, much like Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20070117005952/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2007/01/07/time-to-habari/&quot;&gt;Designer Michael Heilemann&lt;/a&gt; was one person enticed by Habari. He’d designed the Kubrick theme and was looking for a new challenge after the Shuttle project failed before implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael redesigned the Habari interface -- which he says was both a good and bad experience. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_06_Heilemann.html#L84&quot;&gt;He enjoyed designing and implementing it&lt;/a&gt;, less so getting it approved. Because of Habari&apos;s committee structure, a lot of time was spent discussing the new admin interface. People with no design background weighed in with opinions and everyone received equal weight. This left Michael feeling like he couldn&apos;t get his work done and he ended up leaving Habari. When asked whether he prefers a BDFL or an Apache-style model, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_11_06_Heilemann.html#L88&quot;&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s easy to end up in very long discussions if everybody has equal footing. And that makes for a great democracy, but it’s also very hippie, 60s, everybody gets to sit around and share their opinion, but that’s not always something that’s really worthwhile. You don’t actually, necessarily, get a better product out of it. And so often you need somebody with vision, or at least somebody with a point of view with opinion to weigh in.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/24/habari-monolith.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Create Entry screen in Habari&apos;s dashboard&quot; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Habari Monolith interface, designed by Michael Heilemann.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit access was another flash point. In the Apache project, a clear path existed to gain commit access to the repository. That wasn&apos;t the case in early-2006 WordPress. Matt and Ryan acted as a funnel through which all code would be reviewed. More committers were eventually added, but it was a slow process and one that led to frustration, particularly among prolific contributors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from Apache, Rich Bowen brought a different perspective -- which he shared with other dissatisfied developers. For Rich, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neosmart.net/blog/2007/a-clarification-on-wordpress/comment-page-1/#comment-10985&quot;&gt;WordPress didn’t constitute a true meritocracy&lt;/a&gt; -- there was no opportunity for those with ability to gain power and responsibility. The final decision over who did and didn’t gain authority lay with the project’s leader -- it was entirely up to Matt&apos;s discretion. When Matt, in a discussion thread, said that WordPress is a meritocracy because commit access is provided to &quot;the best of the best of the best contributors who prove their worth over time with high-quality code, responsiveness to the community, and reliability in crunch times,” Rich pointed out that because the final decision lies with the BDFL, the community can never become meritocratic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the discussion was a fundamental disagreement about how a free software project should be structured.  &lt;em&gt;In Homesteading the Noosphere&lt;/em&gt;, Eric Raymond discusses &lt;a href=&quot;http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s16.html&quot;&gt;project structures and ownership&lt;/a&gt;, looking at how these emerge over time. WordPress follows Raymond&apos;s outline: the project had a single owner/maintainer (or rather two -- Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg). Over time, Matt assumed project leadership. In WordPress&apos; case, commit access carried with it an implicit level of authority. Those with commit access are the arbiters of the code that ends up in core. Matt &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog&quot;&gt;made clear on a number of occasions&lt;/a&gt; that he didn&apos;t &quot;want it to be a status thing,&quot; but it still became one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt posted to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html&quot;&gt;mailing list in 2005, saying&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Committing != community status. It simply is a way to ensure that all the code that goes into the core is reviewed before being distributed to the world.” But community members naturally ascribe more authority and trustworthiness to those with commit access. It was unclear what it took to become a committer or a lead developer. Instead, the roles developed organically. For the community, authority naturally followed commit access to the repository, and commit access followed high-quality code submissions along with an understanding of and commitment to the project ethos. Commit is a symbol of trust; with only two committers, it appeared that the project leads did not trust others in the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had another consequence: non-code contributions went unacknowledged. Commit access may have been given out sparingly, but authority and leadership were still achievable in theory by anyone who could write code. For those who worked hard in support forums, wrote documentation, or provided translations (among other supporting activities), there was no formal way to progress, gain status, or be acknowledged. Coders receive props for code accepted into core, but there was no equivalent system for those who worked or contributed elsewhere. When there were rumblings of discontent, it wasn’t just coders who were complaining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habari’s approach was radically different. Commit access was achievable by anyone. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070111191036/http://code.google.com/p/habari/wiki/Motivations&quot;&gt;Habari motivations page says&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Our contribution model is a meritocracy. If you contribute code regularly, you will be granted permission to make contributions directly (commit access).” The project takes this approach even further -- it isn’t just coders who received commit access. Owen Winkler, one of Habari’s founders, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_08_20_Winkler.html#L103&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are some people who are committers, who are part of the primary management committee in Habari who I would never want to actually touch the code because they don’t really do development. But we give them access to it because they’ve demonstrated that they’re part of the community and they’re actively trying to advance Habari as a project.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Habari, commit access is an explicit sign of trust and responsibility. If you&apos;re building a project in which the two do not go hand-in-hand, keeping commit access solely as a checking mechanism makes sense. The problem? If it’s not clear to people within the project what constitutes authority, commit access becomes one of its few indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress&apos; focus has always been on users, and maintaining a good experience for them. One of the driving ideas behind Habari, on the other hand, was to create a tool that taught people about development, development best practices, and being part of a free software project. Rich Bowen, who did&apos;t know a lot of PHP, said that he hoped that the new project would teach him about it. Habari eschewed WordPress&apos; low barrier to entry in favor of an approach that would cultivate fewer, but stronger, developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habari was written in PHP 5.1, which gave developers access to &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php&quot;&gt;PHP Data Objects&lt;/a&gt;. This provided a level of database independence that WordPress lacked. Habari developers found fault with WordPress for not using the latest coding practices, while WordPress developers felt that the Habari approach put users second. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-February/010881.html&quot;&gt;Ryan Boren put it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Screwing users because developers want to play is not cool. It’s a good way to become irrelevant. A big reason WordPress is so popular is because it is not infatuated with the latest, greatest developer lust objects that require users to upgrade their platform.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2007, when Ryan wrote that comment, PHP 4 was still running on 88.44% of websites. PHP 5 adoption was slow and many web hosts didn&apos;t support it. If WordPress had made the switch to PHP 5 it would have suddenly become unavailable on a huge number of hosts, breaking users&apos; sites around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habari&apos;s license choice also signified fundamental differences in FOSS beliefs. WordPress uses a GPL license, intended to secure the freedoms of users. Habari, on the other hand, uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&quot;&gt;Apache License&lt;/a&gt;, a permissive license that allows developers to use the code in any way -- even in a proprietary product. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_08_20_Winkler.html#L81&quot;&gt;Owen Winkler outlined the reasons&lt;/a&gt; why the Habari project doesn&apos;t use a GPL license:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There&apos;s the idea of developer freedom. If you give the software away you should be able to give it away with no requirements at all. If you want to take it and make software that you sell, then go ahead and do that. Hopefully you won’t. Hopefully you’ll contribute. Or if you do, you’ll contribute what you make back to the community somehow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these differences ended up being unresolvable, as developers felt increasingly disenfranchised despite slow changes within WordPress. Mark Jaquith, who received commit access while the other developers were quietly working on Habari, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_09_12_Jaquith.html#L73&quot;&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;I felt like […] Matt was right on the verge of loosening the reins, it felt like things were really starting to get good and they left. And I was like oh, if you’d just held on.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they didn’t. By the time the reins loosened they had founded their own project with their own ideals and focus. When there is a critical mass of people within a FOSS project who don’t accept its core ethos, there is always the possibility of creating a fork. This is not, necessarily, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/forked.html&quot;&gt;Bad Thing&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than struggling with the constant debates and infighting that comes from a clash of beliefs, sometimes it is better for two groups to separate. Then each project can keep a laser-sharp focus on the things that matter to its contributors, and on the software and project that they want to create. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Guiding Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that WordPress&apos; founding developers had so much in common. Matt and Mike liked b2 because it was simple, hackable, and usable, and WordPress needed to be those three things too. When they forked b2, Matt and Mike didn’t just inherit code, they also inherited b2’s ideals -- ideals enriched by fundamental beliefs about software that each founder embraced. These founding philosophies informed much of WordPress’ early development, became underpinning philosophies for the project, and still inform decision making about software development and community building today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WordPress&apos; nascent state as b2, the focus was on making things as easy as possible for all users, and particularly for those new to the platform. On cafelog.com, Michel kept a development log where he recorded his thoughts about developing b2. It was often just a list of things that he’d done that day, but some of the things he mentions provided insight into who he saw as b2’s user base. For example, when he &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.com/?p=30&amp;amp;tb=1&quot;&gt;talked about creating a templating system&lt;/a&gt;, he said that he wanted to “make templates customizable by Joe Newbie,” in other words, a templating system that any user could customize, regardless of background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key feature of b2 was the install script, written by a b2 contributor, which made installing the software easy. This contrasted with the most popular blog platform at the time -- Movable Type -- which was considered difficult to install. A simple install script meant that people without much technical knowledge could install WordPress. By the time b2 ceased development, it hadn’t reached the point of a seamless install, but the code and the intent provided the groundwork for WordPress’ “famous 5-minute install.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allied to this focus on usability was a commitment to simplicity. Creating simple software means providing users with only exactly what they need to get the job done. Software is a tool, and like any tool, the simpler it is, the easier it is to use. By keeping things simple, a user can figure out the software from the interface itself, with as little external instruction as possible. The way to use software should be self-evident from the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Michel started b2 development, he made the decision to focus on blogging functionality. He didn’t want to create a CMS, he wanted to create a blogging platform. This meant that all of his early enhancements focused on simple tools for getting content on the screen. This focus on blogging ensured that, particularly in the early days of development, the platform remained simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt’s early focus was on web standards. He wanted to ensure his own website&apos;s forward compatibility -- that it would work in future browsers and devices. Jeffrey Zeldman’s &lt;em&gt;Forward Compatibility: Designing and Building with Standards&lt;/em&gt; was a major influence on Matt. Zeldman&apos;s book advocates creating standards-compliant websites that work across browsers and devices. Even prior to forking b2, Matt had converted most of his site to XHTML 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that many of Matt’s first WordPress commits focused on HTML semantics and web standards. After setting up the CVS repository (the version control system the project used at that time) and uploading the files, Matt made basic semantic changes to the &lt;code&gt;index.php&lt;/code&gt; file, fixed whitespace issues, and converted &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3C;div&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags into heading tags. Using correct tags to generate proper headings reinforces the content&apos;s semantic meaning on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post just after WordPress 0.7 launched, Matt outlined his thoughts on the future of WordPress on &lt;a href=&quot;http://WordPress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20031002112415/http://wordpress.org/about/future/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;one thing that will never change is our commitment to web standards and an unmatched user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplicity, usability, and web standards -- these are principles that guide WordPress development to the present day. Over time and as new people join the project, new axioms become a part of the community, augmenting and strengthening these guiding principles. Taken together, these are guiding principles for a user-first focus. Perhaps this came about because Mike and Matt were users of b2 who blogged before they started developing blogging software. They started developing blogging software only because they were interested in making improvements to their own blogs, and as they made improvements, they were drawn further into the development community. But they remained, particularly in the beginning, software users, which meant that while they were developing software, they retained an empathy for others. This was also true for other developers who became involved with the project. Developers didn’t get involved with the project just because they felt like working on blogging software. They got involved with the project because they used blogging software. They had installed the software for their own blog, found that they wanted to change or improve something, and contributed those changes to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What ensures that the user-first approach continues is a decision made prior to even the fork of WordPress, a legacy that the community is either sustained by or stuck with, depending on your perspective. That legacy is the GPL, the software license that Michel distributed b2 with, and it remains WordPress’ license to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. The GPL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress is distributed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html&quot;&gt;General Public License&lt;/a&gt; (GPL). It contains the terms under which the software is distributed, and there are few things more divisive in the project. Matt and Mike, the founding developers of WordPress, supported the license. Before getting involved with b2, Mike had contributed to free software projects. He’d submitted patches to the version control system CVS and the DJGPP compiler, and bug reports to database software MySQL. When it came to choosing his blogging software, the license played a big part in his decision. Movable Type, for example, was not an option because it wasn’t GPL. As a coder, Mike was accustomed to software-sharing and to working on someone else’s code to make it your own. It was while he was working on DJGPP that he first learned about GNU and the ideas behind the GPL. “I learned about Richard Stallman and read his story,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_03_26_Little.html#L154&quot;&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;. “he instilled those four principles that just sort of inspired me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles that inspired Mike have inspired thousands of software developers. They are ideas that resonate with hackers, that speak to freedom, and a society based on sharing and collaboration. Communities like WordPress have grown up around an ethos that has influenced models of software development all over the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles are the clauses written into the General Public License (GPL), the terms under which the software is distributed. The license was written by Richard Stallman for software he released as part of the GNU software project. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Exasperated by proprietary licensing -- which he believed responsible for the decline of the MIT hacker lab -- he wanted to distribute his software with a license that protected software users’ freedoms. The GPL protects four user freedoms that are at the heart of &quot;free software.&quot; “Free&quot; in this context does not apply to price; it refers to freedom, which is the underlying ethos that drives the Free Software Foundation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&quot;&gt;Free software protects four essential freedoms&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These can be summarized as &quot;users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software.&quot; The freedoms are protected for all users. What this means in practice is that anyone can use a piece of free software -- they can install it in as many places as they want and give it to whoever they wish. They can hack on it and modify it for their own needs. They can distribute any changes they make. When it comes to a piece of free software, the user has absolute freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not enough just to write freedoms into a license. Those user freedoms need to be protected. Otherwise, free software can be absorbed into proprietary software and developers get the benefits of free software, but don’t pass on those benefits to others. To ensure that these freedoms are protected, the GPL operates using what Stallman calls &quot;copyleft.” Copyleft subverts the normal use of copyright laws to protect the terms under which the work can be distributed and redistributed. It&apos;s a method of making a work free and requiring that all extended and modified versions of the work are free as well. In this way, the copyright holder can ensure that their work does not end up being part of a proprietary model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyleft works in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The copyright holder asserts that they hold the copyright to the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The terms of distribution -- that anyone can use, modify, and redistribute the work, &lt;em&gt;provided they pass the same freedom on to everyone else&lt;/em&gt; -- are added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a programmer wants to use a copyleft work in their own software, then that new work must provide the same freedoms as the original work. Copyright is turned on its head. It is used against itself, or, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/&quot;&gt;Stallman puts it&lt;/a&gt; &quot;we use copyright to guarantee their freedom.&quot; A copyleft license doesn&apos;t abandon copyright (i.e., by simply putting a work in the public domain) it asserts it and uses it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPL is often described as a viral license. This is because any code integrated with GPL code automatically adopts the license. The GPL spreads. For free software proponents, this is important. It means that the body of work that constitutes the commons is self-sustainable and self-perpetuating, thus preserving freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see copyleft in action, simply open up the license that comes bundled with WordPress. The head contains the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;b2 is (c) 2001, 2002 Michel Valdrighi - m@tidakada.com -
  http://tidakada.com
&lt;p&gt;Wherever third party code has been used, credit has been given in the code&apos;s comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b2 is released under the GPL and WordPress - Web publishing software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright 2003-2010 by the contributors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress is released under the GPL&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the perfect example of how a copyleft license works. Michel asserted his original copyright for b2 and then distributed it under the GPL, which said that anyone was free to distribute and modify it, provided they pass those freedoms on. This meant that when it was originally forked, the developers had no choice but to license WordPress under the GPL. Michel&apos;s intention to preserve b2&apos;s freedom worked. It also means that anything that includes WordPress source code must also be GPL, so all WordPress users, no matter which form they use WordPress in, have the same freedoms. And when b2 was in danger of becoming vaporware, the license enabled Mike and Matt to fork it, and use the code as a base to continue development. The commons, of which the code is a constituent part, continues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike’s passion for free software is an important foundation for WordPress’ development. b2 was the first free software project that Matt had been involved in. While he later developed a strong belief in the role of free software, it was in b2, and then in the early days of WordPress, that Matt first learned about the free software ethos, as a result of Mike&apos;s influence. “That’s the thing I really learned from Mike,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/2010/03/09/mullenweg-little-wordpress-interview/&quot;&gt;says Matt in a 2010 interview&lt;/a&gt;. “b2 was the first open source project I was really involved with. I didn’t even really understand what that meant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPL complements a user-first development focus because the license emphasizes the user freedoms. This is perhaps one of the biggest misunderstandings around the license. When the GPL talks about freedom, it is talking about user freedom, not developer freedom, and often the freedom of users comes at the expense of developers. Developers who want to use GPL code in their own software are restricted to using copyleft licenses for their products. There are also restrictions on the code they can integrate with their GPL code. To use a library in WordPress, for example, that library must be GPL-compatible. This emphasis on freedoms has been a fault line along which many debates in the project have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freedom of users is protected even further by the sheer number of project contributors. Even if there was consensus among the project’s leaders on changing the license, the freedoms of WordPress users would continue.  Thousands of people all over the world contribute to WordPress&apos; codebase. Each person who writes code for WordPress retains their copyright, but agrees to license the code under the GPL. This makes it virtually impossible for the creators of WordPress to change the license. To do so, they would need to contact every single contributor and ask them to agree to the change. This would include everyone from the most prolific contributors, to those who contributed a single patch, from today&apos;s lead developers, to Matt and Mike, and as far back as Michel. This means that WordPress will always remain free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice that Michael made about using the GPL has been one of the most significant decisions in the project’s history. It’s meant that the software&apos;s distribution terms protect user-first development, ensuring that users are free to do what they want. But what is the cost of user freedom? This is a question that has come up again and again throughout the project&apos;s history as different groups have discovered their own rights and freedoms restricted, whether they be designers, developers, or business owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. WordPress’ First Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the WordPress branch was set up on CVS, Mike and Matt started making changes. They were small and iterative, but they were the first steps that moved WordPress away from its predecessor and marked the real beginning of the project. Mike’s first commits involved repopulating files that were missing from the branch, while Matt added &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wptexturize/&quot;&gt;wptexturize&lt;/a&gt;, a tool he created to properly format plain text (straight quotes to curly quotes, for example, and dashes to em dashes). Mike&apos;s first feature was the excerpt functionality which allows users to display handcrafted post summaries in RSS feeds and in other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, Mike and Matt made over 100 commits to the WordPress repository. Notable commits included WordPress&apos; branding, Mike&apos;s b2links hack, which remained in WordPress until it was no longer turned on by default in WordPress 3.5 (released in 2012), major changes to the administration panel, and installation process improvements. Creating a simple installation process was something that both the developers felt strongly about. It was important that WordPress have a low barrier to entry. Anyone should be able to get on the web and publish their content. Matt replaced the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/b2install.php?rev=38&quot;&gt;b2install.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; file with a new &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/wp-install.php?rev=45&quot;&gt;wp-install.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; file. The aim was to keep configuration to a minimum. In the first version, the user had to create a MySQL database, add the configuration details to &lt;code&gt;b2config.php&lt;/code&gt;, transfer the files to their server using FTP, and then run the script. The &quot;famous 5-minute install&quot; was refined over time as the developers worked to simplify the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While developing WordPress, Mike and Matt were still active on the b2 forums, talking about the new software. But there were a few months after the WordPress project started when it was unclear which fork would be b2’s official successor. On May 23rd 2003, Michel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafelog.com/index.php?p=500&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that once WordPress was launched, it would become the official branch of b2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 27th 2003, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/&quot;&gt;the first version of WordPress, WordPress 0.7, was released&lt;/a&gt;. Users who switched from b2 to WordPress got some new features, most notably the new, simplified administration panel and the WordPress Links Manager, which allowed users to create a blogroll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once WordPress 0.7 shipped, there was an effort to get other developers involved in the project, starting with Donncha Ó Caoimh and François Planque, both of whom had created their own b2 forks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 29, 2003 &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaoimh.ie/2003/05/29/b2-updates-referer-spamming-b2-and-wordpress/&quot;&gt;Matt emailed Donncha&lt;/a&gt; to ask if he would consider merging b2++ with WordPress. Donncha agreed, raising the number of official WordPress developers to three. Matt also contacted François Planque to join the project and rewrite his b2evolution improvements for WordPress. François considered it, but felt that &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://b2evolution.net/about/evolutionofb2.html&quot;&gt;it was too much work for too little benefit&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the year, Dougal Campbell, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/dougal&quot;&gt;dougal&lt;/a&gt;) and Alex King joined the team. Although not a b2 user, Dougal had investigated using b2 for his blog, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2002/11/12/software-development/&quot;&gt;had blogged about writing his own blogging software&lt;/a&gt;. Alex had been more actively involved in the b2 community -- while he didn’t have a background in PHP, he learned it through the platform and the community. He particularly recalls Mike Little helping him refine and improve his code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took Dougal and Alex some months to get properly involved. Dougal was busy with work, and Alex’s first impressions of WordPress weren&apos;t positive. He wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/05/27/b2-wordpress-and-b2&quot;&gt;upgrading from b2 0.6 to either WordPress 0.7 or b2++&lt;/a&gt;. Installing WordPress didn&apos;t offer any significant speed improvements, while b2++ gave him a site that he couldn&apos;t log into. He decided to wait until the next version of WordPress to upgrade. &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/05/27/b2-wordpress-and-b2#comment-199&quot;&gt;Matt responded, noting&lt;/a&gt; that there would be significant improvements to database speed later on. WordPress 0.71&apos;s release announced a 300% performance boost: &quot;We&apos;re not kidding,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2003/06/wordpress-071-now-available/&quot;&gt;the announcement post reads&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;this release will perform about three times (or more) faster than previous releases of WordPress and b2.&quot; It wasn&apos;t, however, &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/06/10/wordpress-71&quot;&gt;fast enough to convince Alex to upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. He and Matt kept in touch and in July 2003, Alex announced that he would &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/23/wordpress-hacks&quot;&gt;help Matt launch a hacks section&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days, WordPress developed organically. A new developer’s first change tended to be a small, iterative step, before they worked on a pet feature. Most developers focused on web development areas they had an interest or a background in. Matt, for example, focused on semantics and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike improved his b2 links plugin. He also introduced &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2003/06/huge-changes-in-cvs/&quot;&gt;wp-config-sample.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. At the time, all b2 and WordPress configuration information was stored in &lt;code&gt;b2config.php&lt;/code&gt;. This meant that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-upgrade-from-71-to-72&quot;&gt;upon upgrade a user had to store the file and information safely&lt;/a&gt;. If they overwrote it, their configuration information would be lost, and they&apos;d end up on the support forums looking for help. Including &lt;code&gt;wp-config-sample.php&lt;/code&gt; meant that there was no &lt;code&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/code&gt; file bundled with WordPress -- the user renamed the file &lt;code&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/code&gt;, protecting it from being overwritten. This configuration file protection was something Mike had done for previous clients, and while he recalls now that it seems like an obvious thing to do, it solved a problem that users had encountered repeatedly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougal’s major focus was the XML-RPC API which, at that time supported Blogger&apos;s API. XML-RPC is a remote transfer protocol, which allows for remote calls via HTTP. This means that the user can post to their blog or website using a client. The Blogger API didn&apos;t cover all of the features that WordPress had. The Movable Type API and MetaWeblog API had additional features that built upon the Blogger API. Dougal added the new features so that the XML-RPC layer covered WordPress&apos; entire feature set. At the time, people would check their RSS feed over and over again and it would regenerate just like a pageview. This could increase the load on the server, slowing the site down. Dougal worked on improving these capabilities, speeding it up by including a cached version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex’s first project was checking in a cursor-aware quicktag code. This enabled users to highlight a word in the text editor and use a hotkey to surround the text with HTML tags. In the end, the hacks section on WordPress.org that he had posted about on his blog was never built. Hacks were superseded by the plugin system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel to WordPress developments, Donncha worked on WPMU (WordPress MU). The original plan was to merge the b2++ codebase with the WordPress codebase, but they ended up remaining separate and b2++ became WPMU. WPMU had its own version control system and, eventually, its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://mu.trac.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;trac instance&lt;/a&gt;. Donncha recalls that WordPress and WPMU targeted different audiences. &quot;Most people just have one blog,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_05_03_OCaoimh.html#L97&quot;&gt;says Donncha&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;they don&apos;t have half-a-dozen blogs running on one server so multiple sites wouldn&apos;t have been a requirement for most people.&quot; Over time, this situation changed as it became easier and cheaper for people to host their blogs and websites, but in 2003, it didn&apos;t make sense to have multi-user functionality available to every WordPress user. Instead, Donncha worked on WPMU alongside WordPress, and merged the changes from WordPress into WPMU. When a new version of WordPress was released, Donncha had to merge each file individually into WPMU. He used &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/diff.html&quot;&gt;Vimdiff&lt;/a&gt; to load the two files side by side so he could review changes and push them from one file to another. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_05_03_OCaoimh.html#L111&quot;&gt;It wasn&apos;t always easy&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I had to keep track of the changes that were made in case they broke anything. So at the back of my mind I&apos;d be thinking &apos;did that change I made five files back, will that affect this change?&apos;&quot; As WordPress got bigger and bigger, the merges became more difficult to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2004, a now long-standing WordPress developer took his first steps into the community. Ryan Boren, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/ryan&quot;&gt;ryan&lt;/a&gt;), was a developer at Cisco Systems. Like Mike, Ryan is a big advocate of free software; he&apos;d contributed to free software projects before, particularly Gnome and Linux. When he found WordPress, he’d been looking for a free and open source blogging platform. Ryan had been blogging for a number of years. His earliest blog posts were on Blogger, and then Greymatter, until he decided that he &quot;wanted something new and a little nicer.&quot; He liked WordPress&apos; markup and CSS, so he made the switch, scratching his own itch by writing a Greymatter importer to move his content to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost straight away, Ryan had influence in the community, writing huge amounts of code and also providing advice on how WordPress development should be carried out. He had more free software project experience than anyone else at the time, and he was on forum threads sharing his thoughts on how things should be run. While he had little experience with PHP at that time, his coding background allowed him to quickly learn. It wasn’t long before he was given commit access to the WordPress repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Inside the Bazaar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these first days of WordPress, new developers often received commit access to the code repository. This meant a developer could work on code and add it to the core software. There was no requirement for code review (though sometimes code would be sent around among developers before being committed). WordPress was still a small blogging script used mainly by the people who&apos;d written the software. Many of the early commits are from names absent from the commit logs today: &lt;code&gt;mikelittle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;alex&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;king&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;emc3&lt;/code&gt; (dougal), and even &lt;code&gt;michelvaldrighi&lt;/code&gt;, who came back and contributed to WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no real process in those early days. It was the extreme of what Eric Raymond talks about in his work, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/&quot;&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Raymond contrasts the open source bazaar-style development model with the “cathedral building” of traditional software development. The metaphor of the bazaar is apt, with its noise and bustle; people talking on top of each other, each with their own aim and agenda. A free software project operates in this jumble. Common sense tells you it’s all wrong but, just like the bazaar, this throng somehow works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two years of the WordPress project were marked by this laissez-faire approach to development. A developer saw a problem and fixed it. If a developer was interested in a feature, they built it. They used their own experience as bloggers, as well as their b2 forum activity, to guide them. &quot;As bloggers, we had similar desires to those other people had,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_03_26_Little.html#L138&quot;&gt;says Mike&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I seem to remember still sticking around the b2 forums and looking at what people were asking about and what people wanted while it was still in b2 and getting inspiration and ideas from that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until later that more hierarchy was introduced into the project, but in those first few years it hardly mattered. So few people were actually using the software. Many of the developers felt that they were working on blogging software for themselves and if other people wanted to use it, great. The legacy of that time, though, is that today&apos;s developers must maintain and work with all of that code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frequently asked question, particularly around the time of the fork, was whether the new WordPress developers planned to rewrite the codebase. The b2 emphasis on getting easy-to-use features on the screen quickly was often at the expense of good coding practices. Michel &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/2012/02/27/les-origines-de-wordpress-la-naissance-de-b2cafelog/&quot;&gt;was learning about PHP&lt;/a&gt; when he wrote b2; he tried to get new features on the screen as soon as he imagined them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simplistic, often chaotic, codebase put some developers off. Before joining the project, Dougal posted to the support forum asking &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-much-will-you-rewrite#post-16&quot;&gt;how far the developers intended to go with the rewrite&lt;/a&gt;: were they planning to rewrite the whole codebase from scratch, or would something recognizably b2 still remain? &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-much-will-you-rewrite#post-33&quot;&gt;The response was that&lt;/a&gt; they planned to structure the code more logically as they went along, with object-oriented code as a long-term goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wouldn’t be a total WordPress rewrite. The WordPress project was launched in the wake of Mozilla’s browser, which was the result of a three-and-a-half year Netscape rewrite. Using Mozilla as a negative example, many developers in the free software community argued that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html&quot;&gt;rewriting software is a big mistake&lt;/a&gt;. While rewriting might produce an all-new codebase, it lacks the years of testing and bug fixes that come from using a mature codebase. It also leaves space for competitors to emerge while developers are focused internally on rewriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a wholesale rewrite, WordPress’ developers worked to iteratively improve and refactor code. For example, in late 2003, major changes to the file structure of WordPress involved replacing &quot;&lt;code&gt;b2&lt;/code&gt;&quot; files with &quot;&lt;code&gt;wp-&lt;/code&gt;”, dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2003/12/the-great-renaming/&quot;&gt;The Great Renaming&lt;/a&gt;. Tidying up b2&apos;s files had been on Michel&apos;s agenda in 2001 and he had made some improvements already, but they lacked consistency. Now the WordPress project had decided to tackle the problem. When the files were renamed with the new &lt;code&gt;wp-&lt;/code&gt; prefix, instead of the old b2 one, hack writers found that their hacks no longer worked, but it was believed that the upheaval was necessary to organize the file structure for long-term stability. WordPress&apos; file structure morphed from b2 to the familiar WordPress file structure used today, with many files consolidated into the &lt;code&gt;wp-includes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp-admin&lt;/code&gt; folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of iterative steps have been more of a feature of WordPress’ development than any major restructuring or rearchitecting. And, over time, such changes have become harder to do as the number of people using the software means that many more sites are likely to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate development, the developers needed a way to communicate. The hackers mailing list wasn’t set up for 17 months after project launch and the project’s main developers communicated on a private mailing list. IRC was one of the first tools the community used for communication. Freenode had a b2/Cafelog channel, so it made sense for WordPress to have one too. The first of these was &lt;code&gt;#wordpress&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IRC channel provides a virtual meeting space where people can instantaneously communicate with one another. It’s also possible to log an IRC channel so that a record of what happened can be posted online. In WordPress&apos; early days, many community members spent all day hanging out in the IRC chat room. For some, it was the tone of the IRC chat room that got them more actively involved in the WordPress community. Owen Winkler (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/ringmaster&quot;&gt;ringmaster&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_08_20_Winkler.html#L15&quot;&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I had stumbled on IRC channels for other programs before, and you know, you ask a question and no one answers or they make fun of you. WordPress was never like that. When I started out, if you came to the channel and you asked a question, people answered the question. After you learned a bit, if you stuck around, you would answer the questions too.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this camaraderie that caused people to stick around. Many of them were learning to write code, making software for the first time, and they were doing it together. Over time, WordPress spawned more IRC chat rooms. The &lt;code&gt;#wordpress&lt;/code&gt; IRC chat room morphed into a place for user support, with a small community of regulars that frequented it. The &lt;code&gt;#wordpress-dev&lt;/code&gt; channel became the place where WordPress development took place, including weekly meetings and development chats. There were also individual chat rooms for the teams that worked on different areas of the project. [fn^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress.org forums were the other communication tool that the project had right from the beginning. WordPress.org launched in April 2003; initially it was home to the development blog, some schematic documentation, and support forums. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20030618021947/http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;original WordPress homepage&lt;/a&gt; told the world that &quot;WordPress is a semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.&quot; The site gave the WordPress community a presence and the forums provided a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, the forums ran on miniBB, but as the number of people on the support forums grew, the software couldn&apos;t handle the load. In 2004, while stuck in San Francisco over Christmas, Matt took what he’d learned from WordPress and applied it to forum software, writing bbPress. Now, bbPress is a plugin, but when it was originally coded, it was stand-alone piece of software with its own templating system. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2004/12/bbpress/&quot;&gt;Matt wrote in the launch post&lt;/a&gt; that he wanted to “bring some weblog and WordPress sensibilities to forum software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the WordPress.org forums are mostly used for providing support to users and developers, but back when they were first set up, they were the community’s primary method of communication. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/beta-test?replies=12&quot;&gt;first post on the forums&lt;/a&gt; appeared before WordPress was even released, with a request to beta test the software. Word had gotten out about a b2 fork and people were eager to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support forums became a place to talk about everything related to WordPress: &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpressorg-feedback?replies=19&quot;&gt;the WordPress.org website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/textile-breaks-when-editing-posts?replies=3&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/weird-message?replies=3)&quot;&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/critisism-of-my-new-design?replies=4)&quot;&gt;requests for design feedback&lt;/a&gt;. People also &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wiki-links-hack?replies=4&quot;&gt;posted hacks&lt;/a&gt; and later, plugins. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers communicated on these open channels, but anyone was able to join in. It didn’t take long for people who weren’t developers to gravitate toward the project. Sometimes, these were people who used WordPress, but lacked the technical skills or confidence to actively contribute to the code. Others were more interested in the support roles essential to a successful project -- writing documentation, for example, or providing support. Some of these people would go on to have just as big an influence on the project as any of the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[fn^1] In late 2014, the WordPress project moved its communication from IRC to Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Support and Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many early WordPress developers got their start answering support forum questions. Support was also an entry point for people who worked on other aspects of the project. A user installs the platform, encounters a problem, and visits the support forum to ask a question. That user sticks around, surfs the forums, or hangs out in the chat rooms. Then, someone asks a question that they know the answer to and that&apos;s it, they&apos;re hooked. Mark Riley (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/podz&quot;&gt;Podz&lt;/a&gt;) was one of the first WordPress.org forum moderators. “You’re a hero to somebody every day, aren’t you?” &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_07_04_Riley.html#L37&quot;&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s nothing like somebody saying thank you. &apos;Yay, you fixed it! It works!&apos; You’re thinking, &apos;Cool. I’ll remember that. That was cool. I like doing this.&apos;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contributor community grew in parallel to the development community. Developers wrote code, other contributors helped with support and documentation. People tried WordPress, liked it, and wanted to help out. Craig Hartel (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/nuclearmoose/&quot;&gt;nuclearmoose&lt;/a&gt;) was an early contributor. He signed up at WordPress.org in November 2003. Like many contributors, he was interested in blogging and had programming experience. &quot;I didn&apos;t have any specific skills,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_04_21_Hartel.html#L7&quot;&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;but there was no better way than jumping right in. I decided I was going to find some way to get involved.&quot; He asked questions, dropped hints that he wanted to help, and after hanging out on the IRC channel, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_04_21_Hartel.html#L9&quot;&gt;realized&lt;/a&gt; that getting involved was a matter of just doing something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project&apos;s user-centric focus meant there were ways for people from a variety of backgrounds to help. Anyone could answer support forum questions, write documentation, or get involved with IRC discussions. Some contributors found that while developers aren’t always good at explaining things to non-technical users, they could translate &quot;developer speak&quot; into &quot;user speak.&quot; These community members acted as advocates for users; Mark Riley, for example, became a go-between for the support forums and the wp-hackers mailing lists. As the developers became more absorbed in developing the software and started using it less, this sort of user advocacy became increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after WordPress launched, blogs starting cropping up dedicated to the platform. The first, &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogtoolscollection.com/&quot;&gt;Weblog Tools Collection&lt;/a&gt; (WLTC), was a blog that Mark Ghosh (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/laughinglizard&quot;&gt;laughinglizard&lt;/a&gt;) initially launched to cover every type of weblog tool. It was the first of many WordPress community blogs, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordlog.com&quot;&gt;Wordlog&lt;/a&gt; by Carthik Sharma (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/carthik&quot;&gt;Carthik&lt;/a&gt;),  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lorelle.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Lorelle on WordPress&lt;/a&gt; by Lorelle VanFossen (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/lorelle&quot;&gt;lorelle&lt;/a&gt;). 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were places outside official channels where people congregated -- where enthusiasts could write about the growing platform, providing information, tutorials, and commentary. Some focused on tutorials, sharing guides on how to do things with WordPress, others created lists of plugins and themes that drew large amounts of traffic. Mark Riley’s tamba2 blog, for example, was home to a number of popular tutorials, and Lorelle VanFossen, who wrote many popular tutorials, ported her writing over to WordPress’ official documentation. The authors soon discovered that people were interested in what they had to say. “I suddenly got all of this attention for not knowing a lot and not really doing a lot,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_04_28_Ghosh.html#L26&quot;&gt;says Mark Ghosh&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;and that really pleased me.&quot; The community respect he got for running WLTC spurred him to help out more with the forums, write his own plugins, and get more involved. Posts on WLTC about platforms like Movable Type quickly tailed off and almost all of the posts are on WordPress, or on migrating from other platforms to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its peak, WLTC received 12,000 to 15,000 unique hits per day, but Mark was never fully able to take advantage of the traffic. Running a niche community blog takes a lot of work and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_04_28_Ghosh.html#L61&quot;&gt;doesn&apos;t result in a huge monetary payoff&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Most of the people who came to WLTC wanted news about plugins, or they wanted to know how to do X, Y, or Z. They were trying to find this information and the quality of audience was kind of low.&quot; These site visitors weren&apos;t necessarily valuable to advertisers. However, WLTC played a major role in the WordPress community&apos;s development, providing a home for discussion and debate away from WordPress.org. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the project attracting so many writers and bloggers it&apos;s no surprise that six months after the project launch there were calls for documentation. Users needed it and there were people willing to write it. The people answering questions on the forums saw this need -- users asked the same questions over and over again. With good documentation they could help themselves. In November 2003, WordPress’ first mailing list was set up -- to discuss WordPress documentation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first schematic documentation was on the WordPress.org website, but this was merely an outline that lacked content. By and large they were holding pages for content that was promised in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/8/2003_10_docs.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WordPress.org &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20031203161840/http://wordpress.org/docs/&quot;&gt;docs page in late 2003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2003/12/wordpress-wiki/&quot;&gt;December 2003, the WordPress wiki launched&lt;/a&gt;. Now, any contributor could help with documentation. Free software projects often use wikis for their docs. The advantage is that anyone can easily edit the content. Some wikis require a login, while others can be edited by anyone. The downside to using a wiki is that contributors have to learn a new tool with a new syntax for creating content. This is particularly onerous when the free software project is a CMS. A further problem is that, without careful curation, it can become messy, out-of-date, and difficult to navigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, the wiki was designed to complement the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20030811221523/http://wordpress.org/docs/&quot;&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20031224140754/http://wiki.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;landing page informed visitors&lt;/a&gt; that it was &quot;designed for us to be able to work together on projects.&quot; While developers worked toward shipping WordPress 1.0 in January 2004, other community members worked furiously on the wiki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in contrast to the aborted work on the official documentation. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040402000122/http://wordpress.org/docs/faq/&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040411104706/http://wordpress.org/docs/template/&quot;&gt;template documentation&lt;/a&gt; were created. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040323105321/http://wiki.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;majority of documentation was written on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the official docs felt formal and rigid -- a place for only official documentation writers -- the wiki was informal and free-form, an experimental place where anyone could help out. By July 2004, the wiki was the main documentation for WordPress. It needed a name. In WordPress&apos; IRC chat room, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/profile/monkinetic&quot;&gt;monkinetic&lt;/a&gt;) suggested &quot;Codex.” The community loved the suggestion. Matt said it was &quot;short, sweet, and we can totally own that word on Google.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing documentation for WordPress wasn’t always easy, particularly in those first few years. In a post on WordPress.org, Cena Mayo (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/cena/&quot;&gt;cena&lt;/a&gt;), who had taken on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2004/03/a-brief-introduction/&quot;&gt;role of reporting on the WordPress.org blog&lt;/a&gt;, outlined &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/state-of-the-docs-address/&quot;&gt;some of the issues&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Part of the problem is the rapidly changing face of WordPress itself. The CVS is currently at version 1.2-alpha, with almost daily updates. 1.2, which will be the next official release, is much different from the widely used 1.0.1/1.02 series, and even more different from the still-used .72.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With changing file structures, new features appearing, new template tags, and new database tables, writing formal documentation must have felt, with this rate of change, like a pointless task. By April 2004, the software changed so fast that much of the documentation on hacks (the standard way of extending WordPress) was out of date. With WordPress 1.2 shipping in May, a huge amount of documentation needed to be written. But just before release, something happened that distracted contributors from writing documentation and writing code, and that brought together everyone in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Freedom Zero&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2004, Movable Type was the most popular self-hosted blogging platform. The blogcensus.net service pegged Movable Type at &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20040202101816/http://blogcensus.net/?page=tools&quot;&gt;70% of the market share for self-hosted blog platforms&lt;/a&gt; in February 2004. It was used all over the world, by everyone from individual bloggers to big media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 13th 2004, Six Apart, the company behind Movable Type, &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20040605225637/http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/movable_type_de.shtml&quot;&gt;announced changes to Movable Type’s license&lt;/a&gt;. Movable Type 3.0, the newest version, came with licensing restrictions, which meant that users not only had to pay for software that was previously free, but pay for each additional software installation. Movable Type users were upset and angry about the license changes, and they took to their blogs to tell the world. Anil Dash (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/anildash/&quot;&gt;anildash&lt;/a&gt;), who was Vice President and Chief Evangelist at Six Apart, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_06_28_Dash.html#L9&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nobody had ever had an audience where by definition every single one of your customers had a blog before. And so nobody had ever had a social media shit storm before. And now you can see a fast food company makes a stupid tweet, and they have like a checklist. They’re like, oh, okay, we fired the intern, we’re sorry, it won’t happen again, here’s the hashtag for how we’re going to apologize, we made a donation… like you just run through the list. It doesn’t even get attention unless it’s something really egregious. But it hadn’t happened before. And mostly because nobody else had a lot of customers that were bloggers before. So you might have one. But every single person we’d ever had as a customer was a blogger.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respected programmer and writer, Mark Pilgrim, wrote one of the most influential posts on the license changes. In his post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20070911032533/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0&quot;&gt;Freedom Zero&lt;/a&gt;, Pilgrim reminds his readers that while Movable Type had been &quot;free&quot; (as in free from cost), it wasn&apos;t free according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&quot;&gt;definition of the Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (free as in freedom, not as in beer), and while the source code might be available, it wasn&apos;t open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.org/docs/definition.php&quot;&gt;as defined by the Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. He described Movable Type as having been &quot;free enough&quot;; developers could hack on the code and add features, and while they couldn&apos;t redistribute their modifications, they could share patches, so everyone had been happy enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilgrim, like Movable Type’s other customers, had watched as Movable Type 2.6 fell behind, while Six Apart focused on their growing hosted platform: Typepad. He, and others, waited for Movable Type 3.0 to appear, only to discover that the new features were lacking and, worse, there was a new licensing plan, so that &quot;free enough&quot; no longer meant free in any sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue to run his sites, Pilgrim would have to pay $535. Instead of paying that money to Six Apart, he donated it to WordPress. &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20070911032533/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0&quot;&gt;He wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program, for any purpose. WordPress gives me that freedom; Movable Type does not. It never really did, but it was free enough so we all looked the other way, myself included. But Movable Type 3.0 changes the rules, and prices me right out of the market. I do not have the freedom to run the program for any purpose; I only have the limited set of freedoms that Six Apart chooses to bestow upon me, and every new version seems to bestow fewer and fewer freedoms. With Movable Type 2.6, I was allowed to run 11 sites. In 3.0, that right will cost me $535.
&lt;p&gt;WordPress is free software. Its rules will never change. In the event that the WordPress community disbands and development stops, a new community can form around the orphaned code. It’s happened once already. In the extremely unlikely event that every single contributor (including every contributor to the original b2) agrees to relicense the code under a more restrictive license, I can still fork the current GPL-licensed code and start a new community around it. There is always a path forward. There are no dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movable Type is a dead end. In the long run, the utility of all non-Free software approaches zero. All non-Free software is a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site now runs WordPress.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilgrim&apos;s post was one factor that led to an exodus from Movable Type to WordPress. Even if users were willing to pay for their websites, what if Six Apart changed their licensing terms again? How much would Movable 4.0 cost? How many sites would users be able to run? It was too easy for Six Apart to change the rules, but WordPress&apos; rules could never change under its GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Apart&apos;s move galvanized the WordPress community. It helped grow the WordPress platform. Dissatisfied Movable Type users needed a blogging platform that was flexible and without restrictions. Mark Pilgrim pointed them to WordPress, and the community was only too happy to help people migrate. Andrea Rennick (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/andrea_r/&quot;&gt;andrea&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/a&gt;), who was a Movable Type user at that time, &amp;#x3C;a href=&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014&quot;&gt;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;06&lt;em&gt;05&lt;/em&gt;Rennick_A.html#L15&quot;&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;That’s when I first heard people starting to say, ‘Hey, there’s this alternative’ and then the buzz went around. There’s an alternative. It’s easier to use. You can set up multiple installs. You can’t set up multiple blogs inside the platform but it was super easy to set up a whole new one on your hosting site. It was a lot easier to install on a shared host too.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/9/sourceforge-downloads.png&quot; alt=&quot;a screenshot of the sourceforge graph showing the increase in downloads&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sourceforge graph showing the increase in the number of WordPress downloads between April and May 2004&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/cafelog/files/WordPress/stats/timeline?dates=2003-04-01+to+2005-04-01&quot;&gt;WordPress downloads on SourceForge more than doubled&lt;/a&gt;, increasing from 8,670 in April, 2004, to 19,400 in May. The IRC chat rooms were buzzing. Craig Hartel &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_04_21_Hartel.html#L49&quot;&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;We saw an opportunity to bring people who were passionate about something to our passion for WordPress. Maybe they would find WordPress to be as good, if not better than Movable Type. We spent a lot of time on the forums and directly with people to show that we were a stronger community, that we weren&apos;t the kind of community that was just going to slap some information out there and then you were on your own.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision not to rewrite the platform was prescient: if the community had buried itself in a rewrite, it wouldn’t have been ready to welcome and support all of the new WordPress users. Instead, they were ready. For weeks, everyone was focused on helping “switchers.” Developers wrote scripts to help people easily migrate from Movable Type to WordPress. Writers wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://carthik.net/blog/vault/2004/05/14/movabletype-to-wordpress/&quot;&gt;guides to migrating from Movable Type to WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. On the WordPress.org blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2004/05/new-pricing-scheme/&quot;&gt;a post about Movable Type’s licensing scheme&lt;/a&gt; reminds users that the GPL &quot;ensures that the full source is available free of charge, legally.&quot; And &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.slashdot.org/story/04/05/14/1314256/bloggers-assail-movable-types-new-pricing-scheme&quot;&gt;WordPress had its first mention on Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, as a free and open source alternative to Movable Type. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WordPress community actively sought out people who were dissatisfied with Movable Type and suggested that they move to WordPress. As Anil &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_06_28_Dash.html#L9&quot;&gt;remembers&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;I was responding in the comments on every single blog post that had complained and saw on every single blog post Matt going in and saying you should try WordPress. And I was livid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilgrim was one of many prominent people who moved from Movable Type to WordPress. Another significant adopter was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.molly.com/&quot;&gt;Molly E. Holzschlag&lt;/a&gt;. Along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.g9g.org/&quot;&gt;Porter Glendinning&lt;/a&gt;, Molly had written a book about Movable Type, &lt;em&gt;Teach Yourself Movable Type in 24 Hours&lt;/em&gt;, which was released the same week that Movable Type launched. There were people who switched for reasons other than licensing. They were frustrated by Movable Type&apos;s functionality. For Om Malik, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gigaom.com/2004/05/29/the-word-press-switch/&quot;&gt;Movable Type 3.0 had simply too many bugs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Six Apart changed Movable Type’s license, it threw into relief the power relationship between developer and user. It became obvious that Six Apart held the power. At any time, they could increase prices, change the license, and change the rules. The license protected the developers. WordPress, on the other hand, had a license that protected its users, and it was to this user-focused, user-driven community, that Movable Type users flocked. Many of those who moved to WordPress would go on to become long-standing community members. It was the first of many times that WordPress&apos; license, the GPL, would ignite the community, and its positive effects saw WordPress go from a small fork of b2, to a competitor as a stand-alone blogging platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. WordPress 1.2 &quot;Mingus&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who switched from Movable Type to WordPress did so at a time when the software itself was in flux. May 2004 was the month WordPress 1.2 launched -- a release that improved WordPress’ flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before WordPress 1.2, developers extended WordPress using &quot;hacks,&quot; a concept inherited from b2. A &quot;hack&quot; was a set of files bundled with instructions on where to insert the code into the b2 core files. In b2, administration happened in a separate PHP file. The b2 user opened a text file -- &lt;code&gt;b2menutop.txt&lt;/code&gt;-- to add the name of the PHP file that they wanted in the menu. When the code ran, the new menu item would appear after the default menu items. To add a hack to the administration screens, the user needed to place the PHP file into the admin directory and add a reference to it in the text file. If the hack output was supposed to appear on the website, the user needed to edit b2&apos;s &lt;code&gt;index.php&lt;/code&gt; file to put it in the right place. It was a convoluted process that intimidated users uncomfortable with editing code. Also, it meant that when a user updated b2, they had to save the text file and the index file to ensure that their changes weren’t overwritten, and integrate their changes back into the new files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1008&quot;&gt;plugin system&lt;/a&gt; brought dramatic changes. It uses hooks to enable developers to extend WordPress without having to edit core files. Hooks are triggers placed throughout the codebase that developers use to run their own code and modify the software. There are two types of hooks: filters and actions. Filters were already available in b2 for developers to create hacks, which changed content. For example, by using &lt;code&gt;the&lt;em&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; filter, a developer can modify content under conditions they specify. Actions, which were first added to WordPress 1.2, allowed developers to run code when events happened. For example, by using the &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;publish&lt;/code&gt; action, a developer can run code whenever a post is published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin system is an example of Ryan Boren&apos;s influence early in the project. As many other developers’ involvement trailed off, he dove straight in to development. Mike Little recalls how he hadn’t noticed Ryan at first, that he’d been active, but quiet about his contributions. It was the plugin system that &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_04_17_Little.html#L265&quot;&gt;made Mike really take notice&lt;/a&gt;: “It shone brighter than most of the other things that people were doing. And that&apos;s not to say that people weren&apos;t doing good stuff, they were, but that was a step change. The hook system was a step change in WordPress development, and it was probably the first step on quite honestly making it the superior product that it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin system transformed WordPress for core developers and the wider community. It meant that the core product didn’t need to include every developer&apos;s pet feature, just the features that made sense for a majority of users. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_05_15_Boren1.html#L65&quot;&gt;Ryan says that&lt;/a&gt; the plugin system enabled core developers to implement the 80/20 rule: &quot;Is this useful to 80% of our users? If not, try it in a plugin.&quot; Unlike hacks, which involved editing core files, plugins could be dropped into a directory in a user&apos;s WordPress install. Non-technical users were able to extend their blogs without having to mess around with PHP. The barrier to entry around extending WordPress inched lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first plugin -- which is still bundled with WordPress --  the &lt;a href=&quot;//core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1340&quot;&gt;Hello Dolly plugin&lt;/a&gt;, randomly displays a lyric from the Louis Armstrong song &lt;em&gt;Hello, Dolly!&lt;/em&gt; in the top right of the admin dashboard. It was intended as a guide to making plugins. The second plugin was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/blogtimes/&quot;&gt;blogtimes plugin&lt;/a&gt;, which generated a bar graph image showing when posts were created over a certain period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationalization was another major advancement in WordPress 1.2. From its very beginning, the WordPress community was international in nature. The original developers were from the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/world-domination-?replies=43&quot;&gt;forum thread from January 2004 shows how international the growing community was&lt;/a&gt;. Community members came from Hong Kong, Wales, New Zealand, Japan, and Brazil. With people from all over the world using WordPress, translations soon followed. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20031205101812/http://wordpress.xwd.jp/&quot;&gt;Japanese WordPress site was set up in December 2003&lt;/a&gt;, only six months after WordPress launched. As WordPress wasn&apos;t yet set up for localization at that time, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/otsukare&quot;&gt;Otsukare&lt;/a&gt;), a community member from Japan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/localization-help-needed?replies=102&quot;&gt;created a multilingual fork of WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. This was an internationalized version of WordPress that people could use to make their own localizations. It was popular among WordPress users from non-English speaking countries who wanted WordPress in their own language. Its popularity emphasized the necessity of internationalizing WordPress. A lack of proper internationalization tools in WordPress could have led many community members to use the fork instead. Maintaining two codebases in this way would have been inefficient and bug-prone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/&quot;&gt;gettext&lt;/a&gt; to internationalize WordPress, which he used in the GNOME project. It involves marking up translatable strings with the &lt;code&gt;gettext()&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress#Localization_Technology&quot;&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;, so that a &lt;code&gt;.pot&lt;/code&gt; file is generated containing all the translation strings. Translators translate the strings and generate &lt;code&gt;.po&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.mo&lt;/code&gt; files for localized versions of WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To internationalize WordPress, Ryan wrapped the translatable strings with the &lt;code&gt;gettext()&lt;/code&gt; function and put them in a format that provided a full string to the translator, which retained context. He went through the code, one line at a time, found everything that could be translated, and marked it up. This meant that when WordPress 1.2 was released, it not only contained the plugin API, but was fully internationalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 19th 2004 -- before WordPress 1.2 was even released with the first official &lt;code&gt;.pot&lt;/code&gt; file -- Pankaj Narula (&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/profile/pankaj&quot;&gt;panjak&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2004/05/wordpress-in-hindi/&quot;&gt;released the first full localization in Hindi using the new gettext method&lt;/a&gt;. Following the release of WordPress 1.2, there was an explosion of WordPress translations, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/localizing-wordpress-12-i18n-and-l10n/page/3?replies=69%23post-35436&quot;&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/localizing-wordpress-12-i18n-and-l10n/page/3?replies=69%23post-35436#post-56422&quot;&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 1.2 made WordPress much more accessible and available to a wider group of people. The plugin system turned WordPress from a straightforward blogging tool into a publishing platform that anyone could extend -- all you needed was a bit of PHP knowledge. And if you couldn’t write PHP, you still had access to the ever-widening commons of plugins, as developers created new plugins and distributed their code. Internationalized code meant that it was now possible for people all over the world to have WordPress in their own language, and a community of translators quickly grew around the software. Naoko Takano (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/Nao&quot;&gt;Nao&lt;/a&gt;), who was an early member of the Japanese community, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_05_30_Takano.html#L42&quot;&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; that there were other free software projects that didn’t take translations seriously and that WordPress’ internationalization efforts encouraged her to join the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11. The Birth of wp-hackers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 1.2 development discussions happened in the support forums, the IRC chat rooms, and via private chat and email. But the community was growing. The switchers from Movable Type had increased WordPress’ user base, proper internationalization made WordPress more usable worldwide, and the plugin system allowed developers to extend the platform. The growing community needed more diverse communication channels with which to manage development, communicate, and support users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many community members were happy with just the forums and IRC, but some developers wanted a mailing list. This was the case particularly for developers with free software project experience. A mailing list is one of the most important communication tools in a free software project, and at the time, WordPress had no development mailing lists. It took more than a year after the project’s inception for WordPress’ developer infrastructure to take shape. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040402000122/http://wordpress.org/docs/faq/&quot;&gt;FAQ on WordPress.org reflects the approach to development at the time&lt;/a&gt;:	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a programmer/designer/hacker — can I help with the development of WP?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sure you can! Post your suggestions and requests for features in the forums. Design or alter some hacks to add functionality to the WP suite of tools. Got some cool ideas on an innovative design? By all means, build it and show it off! If you want to be directly involved in the daily development of WP, the best way is to show your competence by building clean hacks or patches that conform to the developer guidelines. Once you have some code out there, contact Matt and he’ll talk to you about getting you involved more directly with development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the process: post on the forums, blog about it, and email the lead developers. There wasn’t a clear, single entry point for developers to go. The forum &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21&quot;&gt;didn’t provide the proper infrastructure that developers were used to on free software projects&lt;/a&gt;. Ryan Boren had Linux development experience. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21#post-7523&quot;&gt;He posted to a discussion thread on the forum in 2003&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Communities are built around development mailing lists. That&apos;s where the bazaar really takes place. A BB [bulletin board] isn&apos;t nearly as good for sending and reviewing patches, performing UI reviews, and so forth. The BB is a nice resource that has its purpose, but a mailing list is better suited to development traffic. I would much rather use my favorite email client with its editing, sorting, and filtering capabilities than any web BB. Plus, the mail comes to me, not me to it.
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I send all of my patches directly to Matt. I hope he gets them. If there was a development mailer, I would send the patches there so all interested parties could give them a look and see what people are working on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was, in fact, a mailing list, but it was a private one with just Matt, Mike, and the other early developers. It wasn’t publicly archived and it wasn’t possible for anyone to get involved with the discussion. There were no plans to create a public mailing list as, at the time, they preferred development discussion to take place on the WordPress forums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That discussion thread contains a seed of contention in the WordPress community -- the division between people who didn’t write code and people who did. A developer mailing list could segregate the community into different groups -- on the one hand developers, and on the other, everyone else. “It&apos;s exactly the mentality that causes most OS projects to become these developer-heavy, &apos;in-the-know&apos; kind of places that make them unpleasant (and unapproachable) for the average user,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/development-culture-at-wp?replies=21#post-7536)&quot;&gt;wrote Cena&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with a growing developer base, a mailing list was inevitable. A mailing list  enables developers to ask questions about development, review patches, and discuss new features. A developer can send a patch to the mailing list and anyone can review it. It also helps to prevent the bottlenecks that can occur when a patch is sent privately to a developer and sits in their inbox waiting for review. Often, advanced users participate -- those who either have questions about the product or who want to answer others&apos; questions. Mailing lists serve a different purpose than an IRC chat room. To participate in a chat room, a person needs to be online at the time a discussion takes place. They can follow up by reading logs (if the chat room is logged), but that’s after-the-fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mailing list in the project, however, wasn’t wp-hackers, but wp-docs, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090107221645/http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/docs/2003-November/000000.html&quot;&gt;set up in November 2003&lt;/a&gt; to discuss WordPress’ documentation and wiki. It was active for six months before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/&quot;&gt;hackers mailing list&lt;/a&gt; was set up in June 2004. This later moved to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/&quot;&gt;wp-hackers&lt;/a&gt;. Development discussion shifted from the forums to the mailing list, leaving the forums as a place to provide support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wp-hackers mailing list exploded with activity, busy with heated discussions about issues such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://plugins.lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2005-January/003617.html&quot;&gt;whether comment links should be nofollow&lt;/a&gt; to discourage spammers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-August/001335.html&quot;&gt;the best way to format the date&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-December/003462.html&quot;&gt;how to start translating WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. Developers finally had a place to congregate. They embraced the new communication platform -- their new home in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted in the 2003 support forum discussion, the mailing list further cemented the division between those who provided support (whether by answering support tickets or writing documentation) and those who wrote code. Coders are usually more focused on solving code problems than helping with user support. But those providing support sometimes needed the input of those who wrote the code. It &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/hackers/2004-July/000962.html&quot;&gt;frustrated many support forum volunteers&lt;/a&gt; that the project’s developers weren’t usually available to help out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, wp-hackers became an important place for WordPress development, particularly during the project’s early growth. As is the general trend with mailing lists, it became less useful over time, but for the first few years after it launched, there was ongoing discussion about WordPress development. Many important features were discussed and debated. It was the place where many of today’s developers had their first taste of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Plugin Repository was the other development resource that appeared around this time. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/news/2005/01/the-wordpress-plugin-repository/&quot;&gt;WordPress Plugin Repository&lt;/a&gt; launched in January 2005. Hosted at dev.wp-plugins.org, and powered by subversion and trac, it’s quite different from the user-friendly plugin directory that we’re used to today. Literally, the plugin repository was just a code repository. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make it a little more accessible, a wiki was used to create an early version of the Plugin Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/11/plugin-directory-2005.jpg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first version of the WordPress Plugin Directory, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20051124163617/http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/PluginDirectory&quot;&gt;late 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being full of developer tools, it didn’t have an easy interface to allow users to find the right plugins. Trac and wikis can often be difficult for non-technical software users to navigate. Users just want to get what they want, easily, and interfaces that look code-heavy can be confusing and off-putting. For developers, however, the repository nurtured the free software community’s inclination toward code sharing, and was the first step toward the plugin directory on WordPress.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This choice of the word &quot;free&quot; in this context has dogged the Free Software Foundation throughout its life. The uninitiated think that &quot;free&quot; refers to cost. The Free Software Foundation often has to qualify &quot;free&quot; with the statement &quot;free as in freedom, not as in beer.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Story of WordPress - Part 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[1.

Hello World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was February, 2002 and Matt Mullenweg (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/matt&quot;&gt;matt&lt;/a&gt;) was in Houston, Texas, home from school. Sitting at his homemade PC, surrounded by posters of his favorite jazz musicians, he downloaded a copy of Movable Type, installed it on a web server, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2002/02/testing-new-system/&quot;&gt;published his first blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I suppose it was just a matter of time before my egotist tendencies combined with my inherit (sic) geekiness to create some sort of blog. I’ve had an unhealthy amount of fun setting this up. This will be a nexus where I talk about and comment on things that interest me, like music, technology, politics, etc. etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A few months later, and nearly five thousand miles away in Stockport, England, Mike Little (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/mikelittle&quot;&gt;mikelittle&lt;/a&gt;) sat in the converted cellar that served as his home office. Surrounded by hundreds of books and CDs, he sat at a desk swamped by a 17&quot; CRT monitor and spent his Sunday installing a free and open source blogging platform called b2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2002/04/21/welcome/&quot;&gt;His first post&lt;/a&gt; is similar to Matt’s. Mike tells the world about his blogging platform and his plans for his blog: &quot;There will either be nothing here,&quot; he wrote, &quot;or a collection of random thoughts and links. Nothing too exciting. But then again I&apos;m not an exciting person.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;These two unremarkable blog posts, &lt;em&gt;testing new system&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;welcome&lt;/em&gt;, are like hundreds of first blog posts before them -- a tentative first step, a software test, a pronouncement “I am here” with a promise of writing to come. What sets these two posts apart, is that they don’t just mark the beginning of two blogs, but a blogging platform that supports a community and an economy, that enables millions worldwide to write their “hello world” posts, too, and publish online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt and Mike published their first posts at a time when more and more people were getting online and using the internet to express themselves. Blogging, while not quite in its infancy, was still maturing. A few years earlier, in 1998, there had only been a handful of weblogs. These early blogs were often curated collections of links accompanied by snarky or sarcastic commentary. These collections were web filters; the author surfed the web for readers who could then browse through links on weblogs they trusted. One of the earliest bloggers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.links.net/&quot;&gt;Justin Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.links.net/www/index.html&quot;&gt;collected links&lt;/a&gt; to some of the darkest corners of the internet, but in addition to sharing the weird things he found, Hall poured his personal life online, and was a key figure in the transition from link log to personal diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html&quot;&gt;Rebecca Blood noted in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, blogs evolved from “a list of links with commentary and personal asides to a website...updated frequently, with new material posted at the top of the page.” It was this type of blog that brought Mike and Matt online, a format with established conventions that we’re familiar with today. Blogging software publishes content with the most recent post at the top of the page -- the first thing a visitor sees after landing on a site. This self-publishing premise has been a blogging feature from the earliest online diaries, to weblogs, to tumblogs, and even microblogging sites such as Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the first bloggers were those already involved with the web: software developers like Dave Winer, designers like Jeffrey Zeldman, and technologists like Anil Dash. As a result, much of the earliest blog content was about the web and technology, interspersed with more diffuse thoughts and commentary about a blogger&apos;s life. With this tendency toward meta-commentary, bloggers wrote about the tools &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1997/11/24.html&quot;&gt;used to publish their blogs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dashes.com/anil/1999/08/pulldown-menus.html&quot;&gt;improvements they made to their sites&lt;/a&gt;. While blogging grew steadily, the community was still considered geeky and insular. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/books/the-close-reader-at-large-in-the-blogosphere.html&quot;&gt;Journalists disparaged bloggers&lt;/a&gt;, and rarely took their reporting seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, blogging started to permeate the public consciousness. American political blogs became popular in the wake of the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Blogs such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/&quot;&gt;Instapundit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Dish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; saw a massive surge in popularity. Andrew Sullivan, the blogger behind &lt;em&gt;The Daily Dish&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.pressthink.org/2005/01/21/berk_essy.html&quot;&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; that people didn&apos;t come to his blog just for news; &quot;They were hungry for communication, for checking their gut against someone they had come to know, for emotional support and psychological bonding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the first indications of the power of blogging -- it gave people a voice online, providing a platform where people could come together to grieve. In his book &lt;em&gt;Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It’s Becoming, and Why it Matters&lt;/em&gt;, Scott Rosenberg talks of how, despite the dot-com bubble burst, blogging increased in the last quarter of 2001. “Something strange and novel had landed on the doorstep,” Rosenberg writes in his introduction, “the latest monster baby from the Net. Newspapers and radio and cable news began to take note and tell people about it. That in turn sent more visitors to the bloggers’ sites, and inspired a whole new wave of bloggers to begin posting.” Since that time, blogging -- and later social media -- has played a pivotal role in politics, public life, and even revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As blogging evolved, so did blogging tools. Services like Geocities and Tripod allowed anyone to create a website, but these sites had little in common with the dynamic stream of content on a blog. The earliest blogs were manual, using HTML and FTP. On his blog, Justin Hall had a page titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.links.net/webpub/&quot;&gt;Publish Yo&apos; Self&lt;/a&gt;, which taught people how to write HTML and publish online, claiming that &quot;HTML is easy as hell!&quot; But writing and publishing HTML got in the way of the actual writing process; the dream was to create a tool for writing content and publishing it to the web with one click. Dave Winer, whose popular &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was one of the earliest blogs, set up UserLand Software, which developed &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/newsPage.html&quot;&gt;Frontier NewsPage&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that enabled people to create news-oriented websites like &lt;em&gt;Scripting News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Open Diary, a community where people wrote diaries online and communicated with other diarists, launched. Then came &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;, Xanga, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitas.com/&quot;&gt;Pitas.com&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. In the same year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://evhead.com/1999/08/we-just-launched-cool-new-tool-at-pyra.asp&quot;&gt;Pyra Labs&lt;/a&gt; launched Blogger, the tool often credited with popularizing blogging. Blogger automated publishing a blog to a web server: the user wrote their content, and Blogger uploaded the page to the server after each post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movable Type, the platform which, at one time, was one of WordPress&apos; biggest competitors, launched in 2001. As with so many popular platforms, Moveable Type came about as a result of developers scratching their own itch. While Blogger was easy to use, it was limited in its functionality -- it lacked post titles, rich text editing, and categories. For reasons like these, Ben and Mena Trott created something different for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollarshort.org/&quot;&gt;Mena&apos;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. When they launched Movable Type in October 2001, it quickly became the most popular blogging platform, used by many of the major blogs at the time, including &lt;em&gt;Instapundit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wonkette&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/em&gt;. In many ways, Movable Type raised the bar for blogging platforms. It was not simply a publishing platform, but a publishing platform that people wanted to use. “I thought it was beautiful. I think in a lot of ways it foreshadowed the web 2.0, not the gradients and things, but the beauty and the white space,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_06_28_Dash.html#L7&quot;&gt;recalls Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt;. Now, “all of a sudden my blog posts had titles and I could have comments and I could archive things by month and I could do all manner of really interesting things. And all mostly with just HTML. Pretty much as easily as Blogger, but with just so much more power.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools got better. Soon publishing content wasn’t enough. Communities grew around different types of blogs. An author’s blog became a way for them to connect with people around the world. A blogger’s first, lone “hello world” quickly evolved into a series of posts that interlinked with other bloggers across the internet. Sidebars were embellished with “blogrolls,” lists of blogs that gave “link love” to favorite sites. Movable Type created Trackbacks to allow bloggers to track discussion on their articles across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was into this arena that the nascent WordPress platform first said “hello world.” It did so quietly, not in Texas, nor in Stockport, but in the French island of Corsica. It appeared, first of all, not even as WordPress at all. In June 2001, months before Mike or Matt had even published their first blog posts, a developer in Corsica created &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/&quot;&gt;his own blogging platform&lt;/a&gt;. He touted it as a &quot;PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and Greymatter.” He called his PHP blogging platform b2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. The Only Blogger In Corsica&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was late 2000, and Michel Valdrighi (&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/michelv&quot;&gt;michelv&lt;/a&gt;) was writing a blog post in his small apartment above a bar in Corsica. The &quot;only blogger in Corsica&quot; used a creaking dial-up AOL connection that disconnected every thirty minutes. He shared his apartment with two cats, &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2000/12/post1447/&quot;&gt;No Name and Gribouille&lt;/a&gt;, who perched on a windowsill overlooking a high drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many bloggers, Michel experimented with different web publishing platforms, and started out with HTML before moving to Blogger. But he discovered that Blogger wasn’t as fully-featured as he&apos;d wanted. For example, it didn’t have a built-in comment system. This was at a time when bloggers could sign up for external commenting services that were often unreliable and unstable. Michel signed up for two different commenting services -- both of which disappeared, along with all of the comments and discussions. Blogger was also plagued by stability issues, and users sometimes joked that the platform was “sometimes up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel was learning the server-side scripting language PHP. Unlike a language like Perl, PHP is relatively easy to learn, making it a useful tool for people who want to start hacking on software. One of Michel’s first PHP projects was a Corsican-language dictionary: this experience taught him that he could use PHP to manipulate data, inspiring him to create his own blogging script. In June 2001, &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/&quot;&gt;Michel started developing b2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a &quot;PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and Greymatter.&quot; He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not much new ideas in it, but it will feature stuff like a built-in comment system, good users management (with complete profile etc), user-avatars (got piccies ?), multiple ways of archiving your blog (even post by post if you like to do a kind of journal) (sic).
&lt;p&gt;The installation will be easy, just edit a config file, upload everything and launch the install script. And there you go, but you’d like an admin control panel? It will be there, packed with options.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PHP and MySQL combination was a good alternative to other contemporary blogging platforms. PHP is suited to the dynamic nature of a blog, in which an author regularly posts content and readers regularly return to read it. Movable Type used Perl, which rebuilt the page every time someone left a comment or edited the page, often making for slow page-load times. As a result, b2 was touted as an easy-to-use, speedy blogging tool. &quot;You type something and hit &apos;blog this&apos; and in the next second it&apos;s on your page(s),&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.com/&quot;&gt;boasts the sidebar of cafelog.com&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Pages are generated dynamically from the MySQL database, so no clumsy &apos;rebuilding&apos; is involved. It also means faster search/display capabilities, and the ability to serve your news in different &apos;templates&apos; without any hassle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features attracted Matt, Mike, and many other bloggers. But Michel admits to being a novice developer, learning PHP and MySQL while building the precursor to one of the most widely-used blogging and CMS platforms in use today. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/2012/02/27/les-origines-de-wordpress-la-naissance-de-b2cafelog/&quot;&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; that as a fledgling PHP developer, he didn’t always do things correctly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When you look at WordPress&apos; code and think &apos;Wow, that&apos;s weird, why did they do that this way?&apos;, well often that&apos;s because they kept doing things the way they were done in b2, and I sucked at PHP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other early blog software developers, Michel was &quot;scratching his own itch&quot; -- a familiar phrase in free software development. This means creating the tools you need, whether that&apos;s a blogging platform, a text editor, or an operating system. In his book, &lt;em&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/em&gt;, Eric Raymond &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, “every good work of software starts by scratching a developer&apos;s personal itch.” If a developer has a problem, she can write software to solve that problem, and then distribute it so that others can use it too. Many blogging platforms, including Blogger, b2, Moveable Type, and WordPress, started life in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being both the software developer and its user, the developer knows whether the tools she creates meet her real needs. When developers write code, they use it just as any user would. They know what works and what doesn&apos;t. Scratching an itch gives the developer a closer relationship with the software&apos;s users -- it’s grass-roots development that&apos;s bottom-up as opposed to top-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel wanted a blogging tool, not a CMS, so early b2 features were focused on creating a frictionless way to blog. Early enhancements made writing easier. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=19&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;AutoBR&lt;/a&gt; was included to add a &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3C;br/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to create a new line every time a writer hit enter. As Michel’s, and later the community’s needs changed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=24&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;improvements included&lt;/a&gt; a basic templating system, an options page, archives, an option to allow users to set their own timezone, and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel believed that any layperson should be able to easily publish on their blog with b2. This &quot;making software easy for everyone&quot; ideal permeated the b2 community and would eventually become a core ideal in WordPress’ own philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of June 2001, Michel was &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1909/&quot;&gt;ready to say goodbye to Blogger&lt;/a&gt; and move his blog to b2. His blog was the first website to run on the code that would become WordPress, grandfather to millions of websites and blogs. A few days later, Michel set up a website called cafelog.com, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=60&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;released the first version of b2&lt;/a&gt;. The software was quickly picked up. &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/07/post270/&quot;&gt;The second site running b2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20020718211541/http://russell.bustakartoon.com/&quot;&gt;the personal weblog of a schoolboy named Russell&lt;/a&gt;, was published in July 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-book/images/2/b2admin.png&quot; alt=&quot;the admin in b2 0.7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The b2 user interface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development didn’t always go smoothly, although solving problems inevitably led to platform refinements. Brigitte Eaton, who ran a site called &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.eatonweb.com/&quot;&gt;Eatonweb&lt;/a&gt;, was the first prominent b2 user. Eatonweb was a hand-maintained list of blogs, a go-to place for discovering new blogs until the number of blogs exploded and hand-maintained lists became untenable. It was superseded by the ubiquitous blogroll and services like Technorati, which started ranking blogs according to incoming links. Brigitte Eaton published regularly, and when she imported her blog into b2 she found that the more posts she added, the slower the blog loaded. This was because Michel didn&apos;t know how to write code for retrieving months of content from the archives. His code parsed every post on the blog to query whether the post had changed and then displayed it. For blogs with many posts, this meant a huge server workload, which quickly slowed the website. Solving this problem meant improvements for all b2 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although b2 did not have an established developer infrastructure, it was open for contributions. The first major code contribution to the project was &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=490&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;pingback functionality&lt;/a&gt;, from developer &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20020921055340/http://mort.mine.nu:8080/b2/&quot;&gt;Axis Thoreau&lt;/a&gt;, who went by the handle Mort. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Movable Type had a similar linkback feature called trackback; &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2002/08/trackback-in-b2/&quot;&gt;Michel added a version of it to b2&lt;/a&gt;. Trackback is a ping sent from the original author’s site to a site they reference with a link. Unlike pingbacks, trackbacks are manual so the original author has to choose to send the trackback, and can edit the excerpt sent. Trackbacks are much more susceptible to spam than pingbacks; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; whereas pingbacks ping back to the original site to verify that it is not spam, trackbacks do not carry out the same checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With users and developers frequenting b2&apos;s forums, a community quickly formed. The forums were a haven for people who needed help with the software. The most popular were the installation, templating, and how-to discussion forums, but there were also forums just for general chatter about the software and about blogging. Developers helped each other out with hacks for b2, and it was on the forums that the early WordPress developers first met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the b2 community, the software was criticized. Michel&apos;s lack of coding experience showed, especially to experienced developers. Blogger Jim Reverend wrote a post titled, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20030910221739/http://revjim.net/item/3955/&quot;&gt;Cafelog: A Look at Bad Code&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; In it, Jim bemoans poor code quality in publicly released software -- particularly b2 -- and criticizes the software for its lack of features &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and poor coding practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel&apos;s lack of PHP experience meant that he wrote inefficient code and used techniques counter-intuitive to a more experienced coder. Rather than taking a modular approach to solve a logic problem, the code grew organically, written as Michel thought about it -- a sort of stream-of-consciousness approach to coding. Code wasn&apos;t so much a tool to solve a problem, but a tool to get the newest feature on the screen. This created multiple code interdependencies, which caused problems for developers new to the project. A line of code would change and break something that appeared unrelated. For Reverend, this type of &quot;dirty code&quot; was unforgivable. &quot;What I do have a problem with,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is my inability to use his code (without extensive reading and rewriting) to implement my own features.&quot; Writing extensible code is a fundamental principle of free software. If code is written in a stream-of-consciousness fashion outside best practices, it becomes difficult for other developers to extend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&apos;t all bad. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040121234436/http://revjim.net/item/3962/&quot;&gt;In a follow-up article&lt;/a&gt;, Reverend concedes that there are benefits to poorly written code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;While programmers like myself start convulsing when we have to wade through such code, less experienced programmers actually like it, because it is easier for them to work with. Because the &quot;template functions&quot; are in the global namespace, they work anywhere. Because the data returned by the database is in a global variable, you don’t have to use any tricks to get at it. It makes extending, enhancing, and modifying the code easier for newbies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Michel&apos;s inexperience gave the code a level of simplicity that made it easy for other novice developers to understand. &quot;In a way it was beautiful because it was so simple,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_04_23_King.html#L53&quot;&gt;says developer Alex King&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/alexkingorg/&quot;&gt;alexkingorg&lt;/a&gt;). &quot;It wasn&apos;t elegant but it was straightforward and accessible. For someone who didn&apos;t have a lot of development experience coming in -- like me -- it was very comfortable understanding what was going on.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;The article also highlights something important: people liked using b2. With b2 they could publish without hassle. &quot;If you are a user of this product,&quot; writes Reverend, &quot;please don’t tell me about how cool it is, or about how well it works. If you read a site powered by this engine, please don’t tell me about how easy you find it to use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people did find it easy to use. To users, it didn&apos;t matter what was going on under the hood. It may have had its problems, but it was a friction-free way to get content online. Where users went, developers followed; even better if those users were novice developers themselves, fumbling at the edges of PHP, learning what they could do with code, which new features they could add to their website and share with other users. Even in these very early days, a schism started to open between developer-focused development and user-focused development. On the one hand, there was a focus on logical, beautifully written code, and on the other, a focus on features users wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having distributed b2, Michel hesistated over his choice of license. The free software movement was relatively young, and many large projects had their own licensing terms (such as Apache, PHP, and X.Org). Until he chose a license, Michel distributed b2 with his copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the b2 blog, you can follow the events leading to b2’s distribution with a GPL license. In August 2001, Michel made a brief statement on cafelog.com, telling people that they could use his code provided he was given credit for it, stating explicitly that &quot;b2 isn&apos;t released under the GPL yet.&quot; People were taking notice of b2 and some passed it off as their own. In October 2001, a Norwegian agency claimed to own the copyright to b2 and Michel was forced to contact the Norwegian copyright agency. In the discussion around this incident, Michel made a statement that came as close to a license as he&apos;d had so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You can use b2 for free, even if your site is of commercial nature. You&apos;re welcomed to buy me items from my Amazon.com wishlist if you&apos;re going to make much money from your b2-powered site or if you just like b2.
&lt;p&gt;You can edit b2&apos;s source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can re-distribute a modified or original version of b2. In no way your modifications make you author or co-author of the modified version, I&apos;ll remain b2&apos;s sole author and copyright holder. (sic)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any help is welcomed. Feel free to submit fixes and enhancements, they might get in b2&apos;s code and your name or email address will be there as credit in the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this makes a b2 license for now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel released b2 under this slapdash license until he realized that b2 needed an official license and started looking in earnest. It was important to Michel that b2 remain free, even if he stopped working on the project. He also wanted his code to remain free if other developers took it and used it in their own project. He recalls now that &quot;at the end of that elimination process, GPL remained. It helped that there were already some projects using it, as I didn&apos;t want the code to end up abandoned and forgotten because of the choice of an exotic license.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel&apos;s choice of license was prescient. Under a GPL license, software can be forked, modified, and redistributed. If development stops (as it did with b2), the ability to fork, modify, and redistribute can prevent software from becoming vaporware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All was going well until May, 2002 when &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2002/05/jobless/&quot;&gt;Michel lost his job&lt;/a&gt;. In the months following, he continued to develop b2, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2002/08/back/&quot;&gt;he wrestled with depression and health issues&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2002/08/they-cut-my-arms/&quot;&gt;electricity was cut off&lt;/a&gt;, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2002/08/its-that-time-of-the-year-again/&quot;&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2002/10/untidy/&quot;&gt;struggled to find a job&lt;/a&gt;. With so much going on in his life, Michel eventually disappeared. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2002/12/spam-the-blogosphere/&quot;&gt;posted about spam in December, 2002&lt;/a&gt; but didn’t post on his personal blog in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The users of b2 had no lead developer. There was no one to steer the project, fix bugs, apply patches, or add new features. People were concerned about Michel -- they liked him and were worried about what had happened to him. In March 2003, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=499&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;thread on cafelog.com&lt;/a&gt; discussed Michel’s whereabouts. Michel’s sister, Senia, posted that he was well and that he was looking for a job, and promised to ask him to connect to IRC and MSN. The responses to Senia were mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commenter said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Please pass on to Michel that not only has he created a really nice piece of software, but he has also inadvertently built a community […] of people, a sort of commonwealth on the blogosphere. I don&apos;t know him the slightest bit, but I wish him well and hope that any soul searching or vision quest (or vision exodus?!) he has embarked on helps him find what he needs. Yet also allows him to tie up any loose ends that he leaves behind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Others had concerns about their own projects:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anyone heard from Michel yet? His last post was 6 weeks ago. I want to install and promote b2 in two projects (one affiliated with a UN women&apos;s project).. but I am nervous about doing so if there will be no developer support available. I am sure he knows that b2 is including (sic) in the Fantastico auto-installer bundled with the cPanel virtual hosting tool. I want to write an blogging article for hosting clients. Michel? You going to be around?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Michel never went back to b2 with the same gusto with which he had started. Eventually, the stagnation made the software unusable. Software needs to be maintained -- bugs need to be fixed, security issues patched, new features need to be added. Blogging software needs to evolve with a fast-moving internet. It wasn’t just the software that was on the verge of becoming vaporware -- the community was adrift too. In the free software world, the community is as important as the software. The community is the garden in which the software grows and matures. Community members submit patches, fix issues, support users, and write documentation to help a free software project flourish. But every project needs a person, or group of people, to commit patches, create new features, and steer the project. When the lead developer disappears without a trace, community members can play around the edges, help out with support and hacks, but, without someone to step up and take the lead&apos;s place, the community dissolves. People move on to other projects, or start their own. After all, if the person who owns the project shows no commitment, how can commitment be expected from anyone else?
&lt;p&gt;But the GPL license meant that neither the code nor the community had to disappear. Developers -- familiar names from the b2 community forums -- forked the software. While b2 itself did not continue, it was the platform that connected Mike and Matt, and the software that would provide the foundation for WordPress. With its simple PHP and focus on usability and ease of use, b2 contained the rudimentary ideals that would form the heart of WordPress. But first, the software had to be forked, and, as bloggers are wont to do, they took to their blogs to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. The Blogging Software Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet brings people from different backgrounds, countries, and cultures together around shared interests. On a small corner of the internet, b2 was forming one such community. People supported one another because they were interested in two things: blogging and blogging software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of WordPress were among those drawn into the b2 community. They were from very different backgrounds, but free software formed their common ground. In Houston, Matt Mullenweg wrote about politics, economics, technology, and his passions for jazz music and photography. Mike Little, from Stockport, wrote about blogging technology, the books he read, and his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt and Mike had very different entries into computing: Matt&apos;s father was a computer programmer, and Matt started tinkering with computers at an early age. Mike, who was 22 years older than Matt, had his first computer experiences at school cut short when a teacher caught him and his friends smoking in the paper room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shared passion for music drew them both deeper into programming. Mike was involved in the Manchester music scene in the 1980s, working at a record shop and handing out ‘zines for nightclub manager and record label owner Tony Wilson. He lived with a local glam rock band, and it was through the band that computing came back into his life. The lead singer thought it would be cool to have stacks of televisions with graphics on either side of the stage. Mike borrowed a ZX Spectrum and used a couple of programs from computing magazines: one of them bounced objects around the screen, the second created 3D text. He hacked on them until the words he wanted bounced around a screen, but the plan fell flat when they couldn’t figure out how to output the program to multiple screens at the same time. Despite not being a total success, this incident further cemented his reputation for being the go-to guy for all things computing and music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time he arrived at b2, Mike had nearly twenty years of programming experience. That first faltering step with the ZX Spectrum had started a love affair with coding, which took him on a route through Basic, 6502 Assembler, Pascal, and C. He learned PHP during the transition between PHP versions one and two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Houston, Matt set up his first business while studying at the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA). While Mike’s music passion was post-punk, for Matt it was jazz. He built computers and websites for his music teachers, including his saxophone teacher, &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20020329153221/http://davidcaceres.com/&quot;&gt;David Caceres&lt;/a&gt;. He also used the internet to connect other music fans in the Houston area, setting up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20020202222327/http://davidcaceres.com/forum/&quot;&gt;forum on David Caceres&apos;&lt;/a&gt; website. Matt used the forum software phpBB -- his first taste of using PHP -- to create a dynamic website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With experience in PHP, b2 was the perfect platform for Matt and Mike to publish their content and to let their hacker tendencies loose. Matt experimented with other platforms, including Movable Type, but at the time, it didn’t have pingbacks and comments were in pop-ups, as opposed to being inline. Movable Type was written in Perl with a DBD database, which meant that customizing Movable Type was more difficult than a PHP platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP and MySQL allowed Mike and Matt to scratch their blogging and hacking itches. They hacked on their websites and customized as they saw fit, and shared those hacks and improvements with the community. Their first discussion was around the gallery software Matt used on his blog. Other developers had their own itches to scratch: developers were talking about building their own platforms; others, in the absence of Michel, were considering a fork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As free software licensed under the GPL, it meant anyone could fork b2 and use it, provided their fork retained the GPL license. By early 2003, it was clear that Michel would not be back. No one was maintaining b2 or fixing security issues. The blogging software at the core of the growing community was no longer evolving. The web, and blogging, was moving forward, but b2 had lost its driving force. In France, François Planque &lt;a href=&quot;http://fplanque.net/Blog/devblog/2003/05/10/b2_evolution_new_features_summary&quot;&gt;forked b2 to create b2evolution&lt;/a&gt;. The lack of b2 development frustrated François and he wanted to continue to develop b2 for his own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cork, on the west coast of Ireland, Donncha Ó Caoimh, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.wordpress.org/donncha/&quot;&gt;donncha&lt;/a&gt;), forked b2 to create b2++, a multi-user blog platform. Donncha discovered b2 while searching for a platform to create a blog network for his Linux user group. He found b2 small, basic, and easy to modify. However, he made major modifications to &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20030302025915/http://blogs.linux.ie/&quot;&gt;create blogs.linux.ie&lt;/a&gt;. The templating system for b2++ used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smarty.net/&quot;&gt;Smarty&lt;/a&gt;, which separated code and presentation, making it easier for users on the network to change their site&apos;s design. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2013_05_03_OCaoimh.html#L54&quot;&gt;Donncha didn&apos;t consider b2++ a fork of b2&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;A fork gives the impression that it was competing -- it wasn&apos;t competing because most of what it did was add multi-user aspects to the project.&quot; While b2 was a platform aimed at individual bloggers, everything that Donncha did in b2++ created a better multi-user environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his blog, Matt wrote a post called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/&quot;&gt;The Blogging Software Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; in which he proposes forking b2. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;b2/cafelog is GPL, which means that I could use the existing codebase to create a fork, integrating all the cool stuff that Michel would be working on right now if only he was around. The work would never be lost, as if I fell of the face of the planet a year from now, whatever code I made would be free to the world, and if someone else wanted to pick it up they could. I&apos;ve decided that this (sic) the course of action I&apos;d like to go in, now all I need is a name. What should it do? Well, it would be nice to have the flexibility of Movable Type, the parsing of Textpattern, the hackability of b2, and the ease of setup of Blogger. Someday, right?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The next day, from Stockport, Mike Little responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you&apos;re serious about forking b2 I would be interested in contributing. I&apos;m sure there are one or two others in the community who would be too. Perhaps a post to the b2 forum, suggesting a fork would be a good starting point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Today, the post that started WordPress gets a lot of traffic when people link to it on the software’s anniversary. But for more than a year, that post sat there with just one comment, a marker of the very early days of the project, when for a few months, just Matt and Mike, in their homes at opposite sides of the Atlantic, started creating WordPress. At the beginning, it was just two developers working on a small script to make their blogs better. By forking b2, they could continue to use the software, develop it for their own needs, and scratch their own itches. At that moment, in a small pocket of the internet, the right people connected. They may have been from completely different backgrounds, but a shared love of creating tools, playing with code, and publishing online brought them together.
&lt;p&gt;On April 1, 2003, Matt created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cafelog/&quot;&gt;new branch of b2 on SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;, and, with the name coined by his friend Christine Tremoulet, called it WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The name b2 is a combination of the word “blog” and “Song 2” by the British band Blur, which Michel had been listening to regularly at that time. He combined them to make “blog2,” then “blogger2,” until he arrived at b2. b2 was also known as Cafelog, which was the name Michel had planned to give to the 1.0 series as no b2 domains were available, and the name was too short for a project on SourceForge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Pingback is a linkback method which authors use to request notifications when someone links to their website. An author writes a post on their blog that links to a post elsewhere. The original site sends an XML-RPC request and when the mentioned site receives the notification signal, it goes back to the original site to check for the link. If it exists, then the pingback is recorded. A blogging system can then automatically publish a list of links in the comment section of the post, or wherever the developer chooses to place it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spam pings are pings sent from spam blogs to get links on other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-fn-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;fn-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Particular problems that the article calls out include the fact that b2 didn&apos;t cache calls to the database. So when there was a new visit from a user, the page had to be loaded from the database and server, slowing the website. The article also criticized the lack of flexibility in the templating system and the absence of cruft-free URLs (known in WordPress lingo now as &quot;pretty permalinks&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[InnerSelf]]></title><description><![CDATA[InnerSelf is a tiny view + state management solution using innerHTML.

Aims to mimic a React+Redux solution in a minimal way, at just 600 bytes minified, ~350 bytes when gzipped. This handy utility was written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stasm&quot;&gt;Staś Małolepszy&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://js13kgames.com/&quot;&gt;js13kGames&lt;/a&gt; jam - a game dev competition where the whole game has to fit into 13KB!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the readme,
InnerSelf is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://redux.js.org/&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt;. It offers the following familiar concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;composable components,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single store,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dispatch&lt;/code&gt; function,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reducers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and even an optional logging middleware for debugging!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does all of this by serializing your component tree to a string and assigning it to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; of a root element. It even imitates Virtual DOM diffing by comparing last known output of components with the new one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining a component works as follows,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; html &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;innerself&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;MyComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; html&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Hello &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;!&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
    `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The component accepts the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter, and returns a string. The return string is a processed tagged template literal. You can read more about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals&quot;&gt;MDN docs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes in a template string and gives out a processed output string. So if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;state.name = &amp;quot;Mary&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; , the string returned would be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Hello Mary!&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; . This is the view part of the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the state management closely mimics Redux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of your app resides in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;, which you create using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;createStore&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; attach&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; connect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dispatch &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;reducer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dispatch &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dispatch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; attach&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; connect &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pass a reducer while creating a store. A reducer is function that updates the state on dispatch of an event (done using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.dispatch&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how a sample reducer would look like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &apos;init&apos; is the state of the application&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; init &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    myData &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    moreData &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; init&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; action&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;action&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;UPDATE_STUFF&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;myData&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//return the updated state&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                myData&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;myData&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;DELETE_STUFF&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// do some deletion, return updated state&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on a dispatch of a custom event, the reducer is called to update the state. Once the reducer updates the state, the dom is re-rendered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; html &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;innerself&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ClickComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; someVal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; html&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`
        &amp;lt;button
          onclick=&quot;dispatch(&apos;UPDATE_STUFF&apos;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;someVal&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;)&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;
        &amp;lt;/button&gt;
    `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The components have access to the state when we “connect” them using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; function. The connect function makes the state available to the component function via function parameters. So when exporting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;MyComponent&lt;/code&gt; defined earlier -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;MyComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t export the component as-is, we return the “connected” component. Finally we attach the app to the root of the DOM node we want it to take control of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// App is a top level component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;attach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;App&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#root&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the live &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/Cweili/pen/ZXOeQa&quot;&gt;codepen below&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a high level overview of how everything works together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_F57CE3ACFA07830C6362E9C7099DA5F32F52AF60C784E3596A75A95B3BBA5B10_1537950088259_innerself.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is the user workflow once the App is attached to a DOM node and all necessary components are have been “connected”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User presses a button (or some other interaction). An event is triggered by calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dispatch calls the reducer with the event type and arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducer takes the right action based on the event type and updates the state (well actually it returns the new state as a return value, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; then updates it. But the net effect is the same)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the state has been updated, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; then calls &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; processes the templates by calling the component function - a connected &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;MyComponent()&lt;/code&gt; returns the rendered string based on the current state. The rendering is recursive as each component can have a subcomponent. More on this later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It then checks if the component has changed (as compared to current DOM), if not, nothing is done. If there is an update, the innerHTML is overwritten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the performance drawbacks as unlike React which does an careful DOM diffing, InnerSelf just rewrites the whole DOM (which it is attached to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the core code resides in just one &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file, just over 50 lines of code including comments. Talk about minimal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rendering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part is the main rendering part, (If you’re not familiar with tagged template literals, I strongly suggest reading about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals&quot;&gt;MDN docs&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;first&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;strings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;values&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Weave the literal strings and the interpolations.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// We don&apos;t have to explicitly handle array-typed values&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// because concat will spread them flat for us.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; values
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;acc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; cur&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
                    acc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cur&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; strings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;first&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Filter out interpolations which are bools, null or undefined.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;html()&lt;/code&gt; function processes a template literal. This is known as a tagged template literal, where the “tag” ( &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;html()&lt;/code&gt; )receives the template literal passed to it as a function parameter.
The first parameter is the source string split into an array, at the point of expressions in the string. So if there are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; expressions in the template, you have an array of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n+1&lt;/code&gt; strings. Next follows a variable length of parameters, each for one expression (relative position of expression is maintained).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;str&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; v1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; v2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;str&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;v1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; v2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
tag &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&amp;lt;h1&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;!&amp;lt;/h1&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// result&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// [&quot;&amp;lt;h1&gt; &quot;, &quot; = &quot;, &quot;!&amp;lt;/h1&gt;&quot;] --&gt; str array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 2, &quot;two&quot; --&gt; expression values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;html()&lt;/code&gt; takes in all the expression values, interleaves it with the string array. If you take the above example string, you’d have &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;h1&gt; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; = &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;!&amp;lt;/h1&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then filter out any falsey value, and then concatenate them into a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;State Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part and last part, handled by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;createStore()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;reducer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; roots &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; prevs &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;root&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; roots&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; output &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Poor man&apos;s Virtual DOM implementation :)  Compare the new output&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// with the last output for this root.  Don&apos;t trust the current&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// value of root.innerHTML as it may have been changed by other&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// scripts or extensions.&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;output &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; prevs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;root&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// event. See example03.&lt;/span&gt;
                root&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dispatchEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;CustomEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;render&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;detail&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;attach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; root&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            roots&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;root&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Return a decorated component function.&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;action&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; action&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;attach()&lt;/code&gt;, it maps a root to an component (generally the main app component). This just implies that the specific component is responsible for the given DOM element, all the rendered content goes under that DOM element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; functions mainly like a wrapper that takes the state and passes it on to the component function. You “connect” functions which need to access the global state to render the html string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt;, which is called when you do an “attach”, or when there’s a event dispatched. The render function goes through every “root ↔ component” pair, and does the following -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gets the rendered output for that component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compares to the previously generated output for that DOM node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the output is different, update &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;prevs&lt;/code&gt;, innerHTML of the DOM node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dispatch a custom event in case the application needs to do some housekeeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is pretty much it, a very minimalistic and clean library to write small applications without loosing your sanity. Check out the video below (yet to upload) to see and a colleague of mine walk through the source code, you’ll find a longer and more dense explanation there - along with some bad humor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bubbly-bg]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a source code walkthrough of Bubbly-bg - a tiny js library to get beautiful animated bubbly backgrounds for your webpages.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tipsy/bubbly-bg/&quot;&gt;Bubbly-bg&lt;/a&gt; is a small independent library written in vanilla javascript that helps you add an animated “bubbly background”  to your HTML webpages. A live demo can be found here &lt;a href=&quot;https://tipsy.github.io/bubbly-bg/&quot;&gt;https://tipsy.github.io/bubbly-bg/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely simple to use, just include the script from a CDN and call the function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bubbly()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    ...
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bubbly-bg@0.2.3/dist/bubbly-bg.js&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bubbly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to integrate it into your build process, you can  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install bubbly-bg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bubbly()&lt;/code&gt; by default will create a blue bubble background. You can configure it to your needs by passing an options object while calling the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bubbly()&lt;/code&gt; function. Sample settings below -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bubbly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    animate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is true&lt;/span&gt;
    blur&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is 4&lt;/span&gt;
    bubbleFunc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`hsla(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;, 100%, 50%, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0.25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is () =&gt; `hsla(0, 0%, 100%, ${r() * 0.1})`)&lt;/span&gt;
    bubbles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is Math.floor((canvas.width + canvas.height) * 0.02);&lt;/span&gt;
    canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#background&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is created and attached&lt;/span&gt;
    colorStart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#4c004c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is blue-ish&lt;/span&gt;
    colorStop&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#1a001a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is blue-ish&lt;/span&gt;
    compose&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;lighter&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is &quot;lighter&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    shadowColor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#0ff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// default is #fff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animated backgrounds can give wonderful visual effects, but repeating yourself and taking care of edge cases can be quite an hassle. Hence the need for something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bubbly-bg.js&lt;/code&gt;  - a configurable, lightweight, dependency free JS library!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes when &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bubbly()&lt;/code&gt;  is called it attaches a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API&quot;&gt;&amp;#x3C;canvas/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  element to the body. This canvas element covers the whole webpage. It has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position:fixed&lt;/code&gt; - which fixes the position of the canvas w.r.t. the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;top:0px, left:0px&lt;/code&gt; - edge to edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;min-width:100vw; min-height:100vh&lt;/code&gt; - so that it covers the whole viewport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user has provided a target canvas element in the options parameter, that is used instead. Once the canvas element has been selected, all the animation is carried out there! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tipsy/bubbly-bg/blob/master/src/bubbly-bg.js&quot;&gt;src/bubbly-bg.js&lt;/a&gt; file contains all the necessary logic.  &lt;strong&gt;You can follow the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tipsy/bubbly-bg/blob/master/src/bubbly-bg.js&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;source code here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bubbly function is attached to the window object to be accessible globally. The function accepts one config object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.bubbly = function(config){ /*logic goes here*/ }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial config &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; config &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; canvas &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;canvas &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;canvas&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no config from the user is passed, an empty obj is assigned to ‘c’. If no canvas was pointed to by the user, a new canvas element is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’ve provided a pre-existing canvas element, it would naturally have a parent, if not the canvas element is the one we’ve created. The following code fragment initializes the canvas element in case we have created it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;parentNode &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;style&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;position:fixed;z-index:-1;left:0;top:0;min-width:100vw;min-height:100vh;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerWidth&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHeight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that assigning the width and height are important, else the canvas retains the default size of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;300x150&lt;/code&gt; and the image is then stretched to the viewport size, which makes the whole background blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the canvas is setup. Here the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;shadowColor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;shadowBlur&lt;/code&gt; are set to their default values if the user has not chosen any option, a gradient is created throughout the canvas starting from the top left &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; till the bottom right &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(width, height)&lt;/code&gt;. The starting and ending color default to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#2AE, #17B&lt;/code&gt; respectively if the user does not select the colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; context &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;2d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; gradient &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createLinearGradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
gradient&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addColorStop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;colorStart &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#2AE&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
gradient&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addColorStop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;colorStop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#17B&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bubbles to display/animate are created and added to a bubbles array. If the user hasn’t provided the number of bubbles, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Math.floor((width + height) * 0.02)&lt;/code&gt; number of bubbles are created. A bubble is represented as a javascript object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; nrBubbles &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;bubbles &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0.02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; bubbles &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// radius&lt;/span&gt;
        a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// angle&lt;/span&gt;
        v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// velocity&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each bubble has the following properties - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;f : a string that represents the color in &amp;#39;hsla&amp;#39; format&lt;/code&gt;. Due to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;globalCompositeOperation&lt;/code&gt; settings we’ll see later, there is no point in adding color, just the formula for opacity matters, which defaults to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;${r() * 0.1}&lt;/code&gt;.  Basically the bubbles take up different shades of the background based on the opacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x,y : the x,y position of the bubble on the canvas&lt;/code&gt;. Generated at random.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;r: radius of the bubble&lt;/code&gt;. Generated at random&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;a: the angle in which the bubble moves&lt;/code&gt;. Generated at random, 0 to 360 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v: velocity of the specific bubble&lt;/code&gt;. In case the canvas is being animated, the velocity at which the bubble moves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until this point everything was just the setup and configuration, the real painting and animation happens in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt;.  The draw function is a IIFE (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE&quot;&gt;Immediately Invoked Function Expression&lt;/a&gt;), i.e. it is defined and immediately invoked inside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.bubbly&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;parentNode &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cancelAnimationFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;draw&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;animate &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;draw&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// other logic...&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//immediately invoked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above fragment the two main blocks are the call to either &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt;. If the user has not disabled animation, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt; function is called with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function as the argument. This tells the browser to call the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function on the next repaint. &lt;strong&gt;This is something you should note&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; is called repeatedly multiple times a second to repaint the canvas (for the animation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then follows the actual logic for the painting/animation (inside the draw function itself). First you draw the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;globalCompositeOperation &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;source-over&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;fillStyle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; gradient&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fillRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;globalCompositeOperation &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;compose &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;lighter&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;globalCompositeOperation&lt;/code&gt; being set to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;``source-over``&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; ensures that it overwrites whatever is currently present. W3Schools has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_globalcompositeoperation.asp&quot;&gt;quick overview&lt;/a&gt; of how globalCompositeOperation works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fillStyle&lt;/code&gt; is set to the gradient created earlier, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fillRect&lt;/code&gt; fills the canvas overwriting the previous image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;globalCompositeOperation&lt;/code&gt; is set to  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;``lighter``&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; which basically makes the overlapping area between two or more bubbles lighter. This setting “adds” up the overlapping color to bring it closer to white, which is why earlier I had mentioned that setting the color for the bubble is pointless and only the opacity matters. Otherwise which ever color you chose would be added with the background anyway and you’d end up with a whitish color.&lt;/p&gt;

            bubble&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bubble&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;bubble&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; bubble&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;r &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            bubble&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; bubble&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//immediately invoked. End of draw()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each bubble object in the array, we loop through and draw the bubble on the canvas and then update it’s position. The bubbles are drawn by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;context.arc&lt;/code&gt; at the  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x, y&lt;/code&gt;  position of the object, with radius &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; and angle &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2*PI&lt;/code&gt; radians, which is 360 degrees. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;context.fill()&lt;/code&gt; fills in the opacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the position of the bubble is updated. The bubble’s x coordinate is updated by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Math.cos(bubble.a) * bubble.v&lt;/code&gt; px, and the y coordinate is updated by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Math.sin(bubble.a) * bubble.v&lt;/code&gt; px. Here the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bubble.v&lt;/code&gt; is the velocity of the specific bubble. In the case of x-axis the velocity is multiplied by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt; of the angle as that gives the x-axis projection, similarly &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt; always gives the y axis projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the four “if” blocks check if the bubble has crossed the border, if so it just moves it to the other side of the canvas. The blocks check for out of bounds of the right, left, bottom and top boundary of the canvas respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example, assume we have a canvas that is 100px wide and a bubble is of radius 5px, and the bubble is moving parallel to the x-axis towards the right. Once the bubble crosses the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x=105&lt;/code&gt; mark, the condition for the first block &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bubble.x - bubble.r &amp;gt; width&lt;/code&gt; becomes true. The bubble’s x position is now set to ‘-5’, which means it appears from the left side along the same height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; function which is called repeatedly via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame(draw)&lt;/code&gt;. That is pretty much all there is to this library.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Source History of Cat]]></title><description><![CDATA[I once had a debate with members of my extended family about whether a computer

science degree is a degree worth pursuing. I was in college at the time and
trying to decide whether I should major in computer science. My aunt and a
cousin of mine believed that I shouldn&apos;t. They conceded that knowing how to
program is of course a useful and lucrative thing, but they argued that the
field of computer science advances so quickly that everything I learned would
almost immediately be outdated. Better to pick up programming on the side and
instead major in a field like economics or physics where the basic principles
would be applicable throughout my lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that my aunt and cousin were wrong and decided to major in computer
science. (Sorry, aunt and cousin!) It is easy to see why the average person
might believe that a field like computer science, or a profession like software
engineering, completely reinvents itself every few years. We had personal
computers, then the web, then phones, then machine learning... technology is
always changing, so surely all the underlying principles and techniques change
too. Of course, the amazing thing is how little actually changes. Most people,
I&apos;m sure, would be stunned to know just how old some of the important software
on their computer really is. I&apos;m not talking about flashy application software,
admittedly—my copy of Firefox, the program I probably use the most on my
computer, is not even two weeks old. But, if you pull up the manual page for
something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, you will see that it has not been updated since 2010 (at
least on MacOS). And the original version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; was written in 1974, which
in the computing world was back when dinosaurs roamed Silicon Valley. People
(and programs) still depend on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aunt and cousin thought of computer technology as a series of increasingly
elaborate sand castles supplanting one another after each high tide clears the
beach. The reality, at least in many areas, is that we steadily accumulate
programs that have solved problems. We might have to occasionally modify these
programs to avoid software rot, but otherwise they can be left alone. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; is
a simple program that solves a still-relevant problem, so it survives. Most
application programming is done at a very high level, atop a pyramid of much
older code solving much older problems. The ideas and concepts of 30 or 40
years ago, far from being obsolete today, have in many cases been embodied in
software that you can still find installed on your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be interesting to take a look at one such old program and
see how much it had changed since it was first written. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is maybe the
simplest of all the Unix utilities, so I&apos;m going to use it as my example.
Ken Thompson wrote the original implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; in 1969. If I were to
tell somebody that I have a program on my computer from 1969, would that be
accurate? How much has &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; really evolved over the decades? How old is the
software on our computers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to repositories like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo&quot;&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt;, we can see exactly how
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; has evolved since 1969. I&apos;m going to focus on implementations of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;
that are ancestors of the implementation I have on my Macbook. You will see, as
we trace &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; from the first versions of Unix down to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; in MacOS
today, that the program has been rewritten more times than you might expect—but
it ultimately works more or less the same way it did fifty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Unix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie began writing Unix on a
PDP 7. This was in 1969, before C, so all of the early Unix software was
written in PDP 7 assembly. The exact flavor of assembly they used was unique to
Unix, since Ken Thompson wrote his own assembler that added some features on
top of the assembler provided by DEC, the PDP 7&apos;s manufacturer. Thompson&apos;s
changes are all documented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/man11.pdf&quot;&gt;the original Unix Programmer&apos;s
Manual&lt;/a&gt; under the entry for
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;, the assembler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/sinclairtarget/47143ba52b9d9e360d8db3762ee0cbf5#file-1-cat-pdp7-s&quot;&gt;The first
implementation&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is thus in PDP 7 assembly. I&apos;ve added comments that try to
explain what each instruction is doing, but the program is still difficult to
follow unless you understand some of the extensions Thompson made while writing
his assembler. There are two important ones. First, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; character can be
used to separate multiple statements on the same line. It appears that this was
used most often to put system call arguments on the same line as the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;
instruction. Second, Thompson added support for &quot;temporary labels&quot; using the
digits 0 through 9. These are labels that can be reused throughout a program,
thus being, according to the Unix Programmer&apos;s Manual, &quot;less taxing both on the
imagination of the programmer and on the symbol space of the assembler.&quot;
From any given instruction, you can refer to the next or most recent temporary
label &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nb&lt;/code&gt; respectively. For example, if you have some code
in a block labeled &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1:&lt;/code&gt;, you can jump back to that block from further down by
using the instruction &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jmp 1b&lt;/code&gt;. (But you cannot jump &lt;em&gt;forward&lt;/em&gt; to that block
from above without using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jmp 1f&lt;/code&gt; instead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about this first version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is that it
contains two names we should recognize. There is a block of instructions
labeled &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt; and a block of instructions labeled &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;putc&lt;/code&gt;, demonstrating that
these names are older than the C standard library. The first version
of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; actually contained implementations of both functions. The
implementations buffered input so that reads and writes were not done a
character at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; did not last long. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
were able to persuade Bell Labs to buy them a PDP 11 so that they could
continue to expand and improve Unix. The PDP 11 had a different instruction
set, so &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; had to be rewritten. I&apos;ve marked up &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/sinclairtarget/47143ba52b9d9e360d8db3762ee0cbf5#file-2-cat-pdp11-s&quot;&gt;this second
version&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; with comments as well. It uses new assembler mnemonics for the new
instruction set and takes advantage of the PDP 11&apos;s various &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture#Addressing_modes&quot;&gt;addressing
modes&lt;/a&gt;. (If
you are confused by the parentheses and dollar signs in the source code, those
are used to indicate different addressing modes.) But it also leverages the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;
character and temporary labels just like the first version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, meaning
that these features must have been retained when &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; was adapted for the
PDP 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is significantly simpler than the first. It is also
more &quot;Unix-y&quot; in that it doesn&apos;t just expect a list of filename arguments—it
will, when given no arguments, read from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt;, which is what &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; still
does today. You can also give this version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; an argument of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; to
indicate that it should read from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973, in preparation for the release of the Fourth Edition of Unix, much of
Unix was rewritten in C. But &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; does not seem to have been rewritten in C
until a while after that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/sinclairtarget/47143ba52b9d9e360d8db3762ee0cbf5#file-3-cat-v7-c&quot;&gt;The first C
implementation&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; only shows up in the Seventh Edition of Unix. This implementation is
really fun to look through because it is so simple. Of all the implementations
to follow, this one most resembles the idealized &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; used as a pedagogic
demonstration in K&amp;#x26;R C. The heart of the program is the classic two-liner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fi&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;putchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is of course quite a bit more code than that, but the extra code is
mostly there to ensure that you aren&apos;t reading and writing to the same file.
The other interesting thing to note is that this implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; only
recognized one flag, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt; flag could be used to avoid buffering input
and output, which &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; would otherwise do in blocks of 512 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BSD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Seventh Edition, Unix spawned all sorts of derivatives and offshoots.
MacOS is built on top of Darwin, which in turn is derived from the Berkeley
Software Distribution (BSD), so BSD is the Unix offshoot we are most interested
in. BSD was originally just a collection of useful programs and add-ons for
Unix, but it eventually became a complete operating system. BSD seems to have
relied on the original &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; implementation up until the fourth BSD release,
known as 4BSD, when support was added for a whole slew of new flags. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/sinclairtarget/47143ba52b9d9e360d8db3762ee0cbf5#file-4-cat-bsd4-c&quot;&gt;The 4BSD
implementation&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is clearly derived from the original implementation, though it
adds a new function to implement the behavior triggered by the new flags. The
naming conventions already used in the file were adhered to—the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fflg&lt;/code&gt;
variable, used to mark whether input was being read from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; or a file, was
joined by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nflg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bflg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vflg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sflg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;eflg&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tflg&lt;/code&gt;, all there to
record whether or not each new flag was supplied in the invocation of the
program. These were the last command-line flags added to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;; the man page
for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; today lists these flags and no others, at least on Mac OS. 4BSD was
released in 1980, so this set of flags is 38 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; would be entirely rewritten a final time for BSD Net/2, which was, among
other things, an attempt to avoid licensing issues by replacing all AT&amp;#x26;T
Unix-derived code with new code. BSD Net/2 was released in 1991. This final
rewrite of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; was done by Kevin Fall, who graduated from Berkeley in 1988
and spent the next year working as a staff member at the Computer Systems
Research Group (CSRG). Fall told me that a list of Unix utilities still
implemented using AT&amp;#x26;T code was put up on a wall at CSRG and staff were told to
pick the utilities they wanted to reimplement. Fall picked &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mknod&lt;/code&gt;.
The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; implementation bundled with MacOS today is built from a source file
that still bears his name at the very top. His version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, even though it
is a relatively trivial program, is today used by millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/sinclairtarget/47143ba52b9d9e360d8db3762ee0cbf5#file-5-cat-net2-c&quot;&gt;Fall&apos;s original
implementation&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is much longer than anything we have seen so far. Other than
support for a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-?&lt;/code&gt; help flag, it adds nothing in the way of new functionality.
Conceptually, it is very similar to the 4BSD implementation. It is only
longer because Fall separates the implementation into a &quot;raw&quot; mode and a
&quot;cooked&quot; mode. The &quot;raw&quot; mode is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; classic; it prints a file character for
character. The &quot;cooked&quot; mode is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; with all the 4BSD command-line options.
The distinction makes sense but it also pads out the implementation so that it
seems more complex at first glance than it actually is. There is also a fancy
error handling function at the end of the file that further adds to its length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MacOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Apple launched Mac OS X. The launch was an important one for Apple,
because Apple had spent many years trying and failing to replace its existing
operating system (classic Mac OS), which had long been showing its age. There
were two previous attempts to create a new operating system internally, but
both went nowhere; in the end, Apple bought NeXT, Steve Jobs&apos; company, which
had developed an operating system and object-oriented programming framework
called NeXTSTEP. Apple took NeXTSTEP and used it as a basis for Mac OS X.
NeXTSTEP was in part built on BSD, so using NeXTSTEP as a starting point for
Mac OS X brought BSD-derived code right into the center of the Apple universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first release of Mac OS X thus includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/sinclairtarget/47143ba52b9d9e360d8db3762ee0cbf5#file-6-cat-macosx-c&quot;&gt;an
implementation&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; pulled from the NetBSD project. NetBSD, which remains in development
today, began as a fork of 386BSD, which in turn was based directly on BSD
Net/2. So the first Mac OS X implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Kevin Fall&apos;s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;.
The only thing that had changed over the intervening decade was that Fall&apos;s
error-handling function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;err()&lt;/code&gt; was removed and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;err()&lt;/code&gt; function made
available by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;err.h&lt;/code&gt; was used in its place. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;err.h&lt;/code&gt; is a BSD extension to the C
standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NetBSD implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; was later swapped out for FreeBSD&apos;s
implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)&quot;&gt;According to
Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, Apple
began using FreeBSD instead of NetBSD in Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther). But the Mac
OS X implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, according to Apple&apos;s own open source releases,
was not replaced until Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) was released in 2007. The
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/sinclairtarget/47143ba52b9d9e360d8db3762ee0cbf5#file-7-cat-macos-10-13-c&quot;&gt;FreeBSD
implementation&lt;/a&gt;
that Apple swapped in for the Leopard release is the same implementation on
Apple computers today. As of 2018, the implementation has not been
updated or changed at all since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Mac OS &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is old. As it happens, it is actually two
years older than its 2007 appearance in MacOS X would suggest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/a76898b84970888a6fd015e15721f65815ea119a#diff-6e405d5ab5b47ca2a131ac7955e5a16b&quot;&gt;This 2005
change&lt;/a&gt;,
which is visible in FreeBSD&apos;s Github mirror, was the last change made to
FreeBSD&apos;s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; before Apple pulled it into Mac OS X. So the Mac OS X &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;
implementation, which has not been kept in sync with FreeBSD&apos;s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;
implementation, is officially 13 years old. There&apos;s a larger debate to be had
about how much software can change before it really counts as the same
software; in this case, the source file &lt;em&gt;has not changed at all&lt;/em&gt; since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; implementation used by Mac OS today is not that different from the
implementation that Fall wrote for the 1991 BSD Net/2 release. The biggest
difference is that a whole new function was added to provide Unix domain socket
support. At some point, a FreeBSD developer also seems to have decided that
Fall&apos;s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;raw_args()&lt;/code&gt; function and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cook_args()&lt;/code&gt; should be combined into a single
function called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scanfiles()&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, the heart of the program is still
Fall&apos;s code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Fall how he felt about having written the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; implementation now used
by millions of Apple users, either directly or indirectly through some program
that relies on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; being present. Fall, who is now a consultant and a
co-author of the most recent editions of &lt;em&gt;TCP/IP Illustrated&lt;/em&gt;, says that he is
surprised when people get such a thrill out of learning about his work on
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;. Fall has had a long career in computing and has worked on many
high-profile projects, but it seems that many people still get most excited
about the six months of work he put into rewriting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hundred-Year-Old Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of things, computers are not an old invention. We&apos;re used
to hundred-year-old photographs or even hundred-year-old camera footage. But
computer programs are in a different category—they&apos;re high-tech and new. At
least, they are now. As the computing industry matures, will we someday find
ourselves using programs that approach the hundred-year-old mark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer hardware will presumably change enough that we won&apos;t be able to
take an executable compiled today and run it on hardware a century from now.
Perhaps advances in programming language design will also mean that nobody will
understand C in the future and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; will have long since been rewritten in
another language. (Though C has already been around for fifty years, and it
doesn&apos;t look like it is about to be replaced any time soon.) But barring all
that, why not just keep using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; we have forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the history of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; shows that some ideas in computer science are in
fact very durable. Indeed, with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, both the idea and the program itself are
old. It may not be accurate to say that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; on my computer is from 1969.
But I could make a case for saying that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; on my computer is from 1989,
when Fall wrote his implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;. Lots of other software is just as
ancient. So maybe we shouldn&apos;t think of computer science and software
development primarily as fields that disrupt the status quo and invent new
things. Our computer systems are built out of historical artifacts. At some
point, we may all spend more time trying to understand and maintain those
historical artifacts than we spend writing new code.&lt;/p&gt;

languages, they often talk about them in prosaic terms as if they were so many
tools in a tool belt—one might be more appropriate for systems programming,
another might be more appropriate for gluing together other programs to
accomplish some ad hoc task. This is as it should be. Languages have different
strengths and claiming that a language is better than other languages without
reference to a specific use case only invites an unproductive and vitriolic
debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one language that seems to inspire a peculiar universal reverence:
Lisp. Keyboard crusaders that would otherwise pounce on anyone daring to
suggest that some language is better than any other will concede that Lisp is
on another level. Lisp transcends the utilitarian criteria used to judge other
languages, because the median programmer has never used Lisp to build anything
practical and probably never will, yet the reverence for Lisp runs so deep that
Lisp is often ascribed mystical properties. Everyone&apos;s favorite webcomic,
&lt;em&gt;xkcd&lt;/em&gt;, has depicted Lisp this way at least twice: In &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/224/&quot;&gt;one
comic&lt;/a&gt;, a character reaches some sort of Lisp
enlightenment, which appears to allow him to comprehend the fundamental
structure of the universe. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/297/&quot;&gt;another comic&lt;/a&gt;, a robed,
senescent programmer hands a stack of parentheses to his padawan, saying that
the parentheses are &quot;elegant weapons for a more civilized age,&quot; suggesting that
Lisp has all the occult power of the Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great example is Bob Kanefsky&apos;s parody of a
song called &quot;God Lives on Terra.&quot; His parody, written in the mid-1990s and
called &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, describes how God must have created the world using
Lisp. The following is an excerpt, but the full set of lyrics can be found in
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/eternal-flame.en.html&quot;&gt;GNU Humor
Collection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For God wrote in Lisp code&lt;br&gt;
When he filled the leaves with green.&lt;br&gt;
The fractal flowers and recursive roots:&lt;br&gt;
The most lovely hack I&apos;ve seen.&lt;br&gt;
And when I ponder snowflakes,&lt;br&gt;
never finding two the same,&lt;br&gt;
I know God likes a language&lt;br&gt;
with its own four-letter name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only speak for myself, I suppose, but I think this &quot;Lisp Is Arcane Magic&quot;
cultural meme is the most bizarre and fascinating thing ever. Lisp was
concocted in the ivory tower as a tool for artificial intelligence research, so
it was always going to be unfamiliar and maybe even a bit mysterious to the
programming laity. But programmers now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/5c14o6/xkcd_lisp/d9szjnc/&quot;&gt;urge each other to &quot;try Lisp before you
die&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
as if it were some kind of mind-expanding psychedelic. They do this even though
Lisp is now the second-oldest programming language in widespread use, younger
only than Fortran, and even then by just one year.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Imagine if your job were
to promote some new programming language on behalf of the organization or team
that created it. Wouldn&apos;t it be great if you could convince everyone that your
new language had divine powers? But how would you even do that? How does a
programming language come to be known as a font of hidden knowledge? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Lisp get to be this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/byte_lisp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Byte Magazine Cover, August, 1979.&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The cover of Byte Magazine, August, 1979.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theory A: The Axiomatic Language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John McCarthy, Lisp&apos;s creator, did not originally intend for Lisp to be an
elegant distillation of the principles of computation. But, after one or two
fortunate insights and a series of refinements, that&apos;s what Lisp became. Paul
Graham—we will talk about him some more later—has written that, with Lisp,
McCarthy &quot;did for programming something like what Euclid did for geometry.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
People might see a deeper meaning in Lisp because McCarthy built Lisp out of
parts so fundamental that it is hard to say whether he invented it or
discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy began thinking about creating a language during the 1956 Darthmouth
Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. The Summer Research Project
was in effect an ongoing, multi-week academic conference, the very first in the
field of artificial intelligence. McCarthy, then an assistant professor of
Mathematics at Dartmouth, had actually coined the term &quot;artificial
intelligence&quot; when he proposed the event.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; About ten or so people attended
the conference for its entire duration.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Among them were Allen Newell and
Herbert Simon, two researchers affiliated with the RAND Corporation and
Carnegie Mellon that had just designed a language called IPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newell and Simon had been trying to build a system capable of generating proofs
in propositional calculus. They realized that it would be hard to do this while
working at the level of the computer&apos;s native instruction set, so they decided
to create a language—or, as they called it, a &quot;pseudo-code&quot;—that would help
them more naturally express the workings of their &quot;Logic Theory Machine.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Their language, called IPL for &quot;Information Processing Language&quot;, was more of a
high-level assembly dialect then a programming language in the sense we mean
today. Newell and Simon, perhaps referring to Fortran, noted that other
&quot;pseudo-codes&quot; then in development were &quot;preoccupied&quot; with representing
equations in standard mathematical notation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Their language focused instead
on representing sentences in propositional calculus as lists of symbolic
expressions. Programs in IPL would basically leverage a series of
assembly-language macros to manipulate and evaluate expressions within one or
more of these lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy thought that having algebraic expressions in a language,
Fortran-style, would be useful. So he didn&apos;t like IPL very much.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But he
thought that symbolic lists were a good way to model problems in artificial
intelligence, particularly problems involving deduction. This was the germ of
McCarthy&apos;s desire to create an algebraic list processing language, a language
that would resemble Fortran but also be able to process symbolic lists like
IPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Lisp today does not resemble Fortran. Over the next few years,
McCarthy&apos;s ideas about what an ideal list processing language should look like
evolved. His ideas began to change in 1957, when he started writing routines
for a chess-playing program in Fortran. The prolonged exposure to Fortran
convinced McCarthy that there were several infelicities in its design, chief
among them the awkward &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; McCarthy invented an alternative,
the &quot;true&quot; conditional expression, which returns sub-expression A if the
supplied test succeeds and sub-expression B if the supplied test fails and
which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; only evaluates the sub-expression that actually gets returned.
During the summer of 1958, when McCarthy worked to design a program that could
perform differentiation, he realized that his &quot;true&quot; conditional expression
made writing recursive functions easier and more natural.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
differentiation problem also prompted McCarthy to devise the &lt;em&gt;maplist&lt;/em&gt;
function, which takes another function as an argument and applies it to all the
elements in a list.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was useful for differentiating sums of
arbitrarily many terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these things could be expressed in Fortran, so, in the fall of 1958,
McCarthy set some students to work implementing Lisp. Since McCarthy was now an
assistant professor at MIT, these were all MIT students. As McCarthy and his
students translated his ideas into running code, they made changes that further
simplified the language. The biggest change involved Lisp&apos;s syntax. McCarthy
had originally intended for the language to include something called
&quot;M-expressions,&quot; which would be a layer of syntactic sugar that made Lisp&apos;s
syntax resemble Fortran&apos;s. Though M-expressions could be translated to
S-expressions—the basic lists enclosed by parentheses that Lisp is known for—
S-expressions were really a low-level representation meant for the machine. The
only problem was that McCarthy had been denoting M-expressions using square
brackets, and the IBM 026 keypunch that McCarthy&apos;s team used at MIT did not
have any square bracket keys on its keyboard.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-11&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So the Lisp team stuck with
S-expressions, using them to represent not just lists of data but function
applications too. McCarthy and his students also made a few other
simplifications, including a switch to prefix notation and a memory model
change that meant the language only had one real type.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-12&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1960, McCarthy published his famous paper on Lisp called &quot;Recursive
Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine.&quot; By that
time, the language had been pared down to such a degree that McCarthy realized
he had the makings of &quot;an elegant mathematical system&quot; and not just another
programming language.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-13&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He later wrote that the many simplifications that
had been made to Lisp turned it &quot;into a way of describing computable functions
much neater than the Turing machines or the general recursive definitions used
in recursive function theory.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-14&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In his paper, he therefore presented Lisp
both as a working programming language and as a formalism for studying the
behavior of recursive functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy explained Lisp to his readers by building it up out of only a very
small collection of rules. Paul Graham later retraced McCarthy&apos;s steps, using
more readable language, in his essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/jmc.pdf&quot;&gt;&quot;The Roots of
Lisp&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Graham is able to
explain Lisp using only seven primitive operators, two different notations for
functions, and a half-dozen higher-level functions defined in terms of the
primitive operators. That Lisp can be specified by such a small sequence of
basic rules no doubt contributes to its mystique. Graham has called McCarthy&apos;s
paper an attempt to &quot;axiomatize computation.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-15&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I think that is a great way
to think about Lisp&apos;s appeal. Whereas other languages have clearly artificial
constructs denoted by reserved words like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;public
static void&lt;/code&gt;, Lisp&apos;s design almost seems entailed by the very logic of
computing. This quality and Lisp&apos;s original connection to a field as esoteric
as &quot;recursive function theory&quot; should make it no surprise that Lisp has so much
prestige today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theory B: Machine of the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades after its creation, Lisp had become, according to the famous
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hacker&apos;s Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &quot;mother
tongue&quot; of artificial intelligence research. Early on, Lisp spread quickly,
probably because its regular syntax made implementing it on new machines
relatively straightforward. Later, researchers would keep using it because of
how well it handled symbolic expressions, important in an era when so much of
artificial intelligence was symbolic. Lisp was used in seminal artificial
intelligence projects like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/&quot;&gt;SHRDLU natural language
program&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma&quot;&gt;Macsyma algebra
system&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACL2&quot;&gt;ACL2 logic
system&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mid-1970s, though, artificial intelligence researchers were running out
of computer power. The PDP-10, in particular—everyone&apos;s favorite machine for
artificial intelligence work—had an 18-bit address space that increasingly was
insufficient for Lisp AI programs.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-16&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many AI programs were also supposed to
be interactive, and making a demanding interactive program perform well on a
time-sharing system was challenging. The solution, originally proposed by Peter
Deutsch at MIT, was to engineer a computer specifically designed to run Lisp
programs. These Lisp machines, as I described in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/chaosnet&quot;&gt;my last post on Chaosnet&lt;/a&gt;, would give each user a dedicated
processor optimized for Lisp. They would also eventually come with development
environments written entirely in Lisp for hardcore Lisp programmers. Lisp
machines, devised in an awkward moment at the tail of the minicomputer era but
before the full flowering of the microcomputer revolution, were
high-performance personal computers for the programming elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, it seemed as if Lisp machines would be the wave of the future.
Several companies sprang into existence and raced to commercialize the
technology. The most successful of these companies was called Symbolics,
founded by veterans of the MIT AI Lab. Throughout the 1980s, Symbolics produced
a line of computers known as the 3600 series, which were popular in the AI
field and in industries requiring high-powered computing. The 3600 series
computers featured large screens, bit-mapped graphics, a mouse interface, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/gV5obrYaogU?t=201&quot;&gt;powerful graphics and animation software&lt;/a&gt;.
These were impressive machines that enabled impressive programs. For example,
Bob Culley, who worked in robotics research and contacted me via Twitter, was
able to implement and visualize a path-finding algorithm on a Symbolics 3650
in 1985. He explained to me that bit-mapped graphics and object-oriented
programming (available on Lisp machines via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavors_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;the Flavors
extension&lt;/a&gt;) were
very new in the 1980s. Symbolics was the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/symbolics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bob Culley&amp;#x27;s path-finding program.&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bob Culley&apos;s path-finding program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Symbolics machines were outrageously expensive. The Symbolics 3600
cost $110,000 in 1983.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-16&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So most people could only marvel at the power of
Lisp machines and the wizardry of their Lisp-writing operators from afar. But
marvel they did. &lt;em&gt;Byte Magazine&lt;/em&gt; featured Lisp and Lisp machines several times
from 1979 through to the end of the 1980s. In the August, 1979 issue, a special
on Lisp, the magazine&apos;s editor raved about the new machines being developed at
MIT with &quot;gobs of memory&quot; and &quot;an advanced operating system.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-17&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He thought
they sounded so promising that they would make the two prior years—which saw
the launch of the Apple II, the Commodore PET, and the TRS-80—look boring by
comparison. A half decade later, in 1985, a &lt;em&gt;Byte Magazine&lt;/em&gt; contributor
described writing Lisp programs for the &quot;sophisticated, superpowerful Symbolics
3670&quot; and urged his audience to learn Lisp, claiming it was both &quot;the language
of choice for most people working in AI&quot; and soon to be a general-purpose
programming language as well.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-18&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Paul McJones, who has done lots of Lisp &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/&quot;&gt;preservation
work&lt;/a&gt; for the Computer
History Museum in Mountain View, about when people first began talking about
Lisp as if it were a gift from higher-dimensional beings. He said that the
inherent properties of the language no doubt had a lot to do with it, but he
also said that the close association between Lisp and the powerful artificial
intelligence applications of the 1960s and 1970s probably contributed too. When
Lisp machines became available for purchase in the 1980s, a few more people
outside of places like MIT and Stanford were exposed to Lisp&apos;s power and the
legend grew. Today, Lisp machines and Symbolics are little remembered, but they
helped keep the mystique of Lisp alive through to the late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theory C: Learn to Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1985, MIT professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman, along with Sussman&apos;s
wife, Julie Sussman, published a textbook called &lt;em&gt;Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs&lt;/em&gt;. The textbook introduced readers to programming using the
language Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. It was used to teach MIT&apos;s introductory
programming class for two decades. My hunch is that SICP (as the title is
commonly abbreviated) about doubled Lisp&apos;s &quot;mystique factor.&quot; SICP took Lisp
and showed how it could be used to illustrate deep, almost philosophical
concepts in the art of computer programming. Those concepts were general enough
that any language could have been used, but SICP&apos;s authors chose Lisp. As a
result, Lisp&apos;s reputation was augmented by the notoriety of this bizarre and
brilliant book, which has intrigued generations of programmers (and also become
&lt;a href=&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/forums/meme-research/topics/47038-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-hugeass-image-dump-for-evidence&quot;&gt;a very strange
meme&lt;/a&gt;).
Lisp had always been &quot;McCarthy&apos;s elegant formalism&quot;; now it was also &quot;that
language that teaches you the hidden secrets of programming.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s worth dwelling for a while on how weird SICP really is, because I think
the book&apos;s weirdness and Lisp&apos;s weirdness get conflated today. The weirdness
starts with the book&apos;s cover. It depicts a wizard or alchemist approaching a
table, prepared to perform some sort of sorcery. In one hand he holds a set of
calipers or a compass, in the other he holds a globe inscribed with the words
&quot;eval&quot; and &quot;apply.&quot; A woman opposite him gestures at the table; in the
background, the Greek letter lambda floats in mid-air, radiating light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/sicp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The cover art for SICP.&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The cover art for SICP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, what is going on here? Why does the table have animal feet? Why is
the woman gesturing at the table? What is the significance of the inkwell? Are
we supposed to conclude that the wizard has unlocked the hidden mysteries of
the universe, and that those mysteries consist of the &quot;eval/apply&quot; loop and
the Lambda Calculus? It would seem so. This image alone must have done an
enormous amount to shape how people talk about Lisp today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the text of the book itself is often just as weird. SICP is unlike most
other computer science textbooks that you have ever read. Its authors explain
in the foreword to the book that the book is not merely about how to program in
Lisp—it is instead about &quot;three foci of phenomena: the human mind, collections
of computer programs, and the computer.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-19&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Later, they elaborate, describing
their conviction that programming shouldn&apos;t be considered a discipline of
computer science but instead should be considered a new notation for &quot;procedural
epistemology.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-20&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Programs are a new way of structuring thought that only
incidentally get fed into computers. The first chapter of the book gives a
brief tour of Lisp, but most of the book after that point is about much more
abstract concepts. There is a discussion of different programming paradigms, a
discussion of the nature of &quot;time&quot; and &quot;identity&quot; in object-oriented systems,
and at one point a discussion of how synchronization problems may arise because
of fundamental constraints on communication that play a role akin to the fixed
speed of light in the theory of relativity.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-21&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It&apos;s heady stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this isn&apos;t to say that the book is bad. It&apos;s a wonderful book. It discusses
important programming concepts at a higher level than anything else I have
read, concepts that I had long wondered about but didn&apos;t quite have the
language to describe. It&apos;s impressive that an introductory programming textbook
can move so quickly to describing the fundamental shortfalls of object-oriented
programming and the benefits of functional languages that minimize mutable
state. It&apos;s mind-blowing that this then turns into a discussion of how a stream
paradigm, perhaps something like today&apos;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/&quot;&gt;RxJS&lt;/a&gt;, can give you the best of both
worlds. SICP distills the essence of high-level program design in a way
reminiscent of McCarthy&apos;s original Lisp paper. The first thing you want to do
after reading it is get your programmer friends to read it; if they look it
up, see the cover, but then don&apos;t read it, all they take away is that some
mysterious, fundamental &quot;eval/apply&quot; thing gives magicians special powers over
tables with animal feet. I would be deeply impressed in their shoes too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe SICP&apos;s most important contribution was to elevate Lisp from
curious oddity to pedagogical must-have. Well before SICP, people told each
other to learn Lisp as a way of getting better at programming. The 1979 Lisp
issue of &lt;em&gt;Byte Magazine&lt;/em&gt; is testament to that fact. The same editor that raved
about MIT&apos;s new Lisp machines also explained that the language was worth
learning because it &quot;represents a different point of view from which to analyze
problems.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-22&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But SICP presented Lisp as more than just a foil for other
languages; SICP used Lisp as an &lt;em&gt;introductory&lt;/em&gt; language, implicitly making the
argument that Lisp is the best language in which to grasp the fundamentals of
computer programming. When programmers today tell each other to try Lisp before
they die, they arguably do so in large part because of SICP. After all, the
language &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck&quot;&gt;Brainfuck&lt;/a&gt; presumably offers
&quot;a different point of view from which to analyze problems.&quot; But people learn
Lisp instead because they know that, for twenty years or so, the Lisp point of
view was thought to be so useful that MIT taught Lisp to undergraduates before
anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lisp Comes Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year that SICP was released, Bjarne Stroustrup published the first
edition of &lt;em&gt;The C++ Programming Language&lt;/em&gt;, which brought object-oriented
programming to the masses. A few years later, the market for Lisp machines
collapsed and the AI winter began. For the next decade and change, C++ and then
Java would be the languages of the future and Lisp would be left out in the
cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course impossible to pinpoint when people started getting excited
about Lisp again. But that may have happened after Paul Graham, Y-Combinator
co-founder and Hacker News creator, published a series of influential essays
pushing Lisp as the best language for startups. In his essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Beating the
Averages,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; for example, Graham argued that
Lisp macros simply made Lisp more powerful than other languages. He claimed
that using Lisp at his own startup, Viaweb, helped him develop features faster
than his competitors were able to. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20061004035628/http://wiki.alu.org/Chris-Perkins&quot;&gt;Some programmers at
least&lt;/a&gt;
were persuaded. But the vast majority of programmers did not switch to Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened instead is that more and more Lisp-y features have been
incorporated into everyone&apos;s favorite programming languages. Python got list
comprehensions. C# got Linq. Ruby got... well, Ruby &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp/&quot;&gt;is a
Lisp&lt;/a&gt;.
As Graham noted even back in 2001, &quot;the default language, embodied in a
succession of popular languages, has gradually evolved toward Lisp.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-23&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-23&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Though other languages are gradually becoming like Lisp, Lisp itself somehow
manages to retain its special reputation as that mysterious language that few
people understand but everybody should learn. In 1980, on the occasion of
Lisp&apos;s 20th anniversary, McCarthy wrote that Lisp had survived as long as it
had because it occupied &quot;some kind of approximate local optimum in the space of
programming languages.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-24&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-24&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That understates Lisp&apos;s real influence. Lisp
hasn&apos;t survived for over half a century because programmers have begrudgingly
conceded that it is the best tool for the job decade after decade; in fact, it
has survived even though most programmers do not use it at all. Thanks to its
origins and use in artificial intelligence research and perhaps also the legacy
of SICP, Lisp continues to fascinate people. Until we can imagine God creating
the world with some newer language, Lisp isn&apos;t going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output contains both a section describing the &quot;question&quot; you asked (&quot;What
is the IP address of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;?&quot;) and a section describing the answer you
received. In the answer section, we see that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt; found a single record with
what looks to be five fields. The record&apos;s type is indicated by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; in the
fourth field from the left—this is an &quot;address&quot; record. To the right of the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, in the fifth field, we can see that the IP address for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; is
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;216.58.192.206&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;194&lt;/code&gt; value in the second field specifies how long in
seconds this particular record can be cached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; field tell us? For an embarrassingly long time, I thought
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; functioned as a preposition, so that every DNS record was saying something
like &quot;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and has IP address &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;216.58.192.206&lt;/code&gt;.&quot; It turns
out that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; actually stands for &quot;internet.&quot; The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; part of a DNS record
tells us the record&apos;s &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might a DNS record have a class other than &quot;internet&quot;? What would that even
mean? How do you search for a host that &lt;em&gt;isn&apos;t&lt;/em&gt; on the internet? It would seem
that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; is the only value that could possibly make sense here. Indeed, when
you try to ask for the address of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; while specifying that you expect
a record with a class other than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt;, the DNS server you are asking will
probably complain. In the below, when we try to ask for the IP address of
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HS&lt;/code&gt; class, the name server at &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;8.8.8.8&lt;/code&gt; (Google Public
DNS) returns a status of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SERVFAIL&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ dig -c HS google.com

&lt;p&gt;So classes other than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt; aren&apos;t widely supported. But they do exist. In
addition to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt;, DNS records can have the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HS&lt;/code&gt; class (as we&apos;ve
just seen) or the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CH&lt;/code&gt; class. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HS&lt;/code&gt; class is reserved for use by a system
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod_(name_service)&quot;&gt;Hesiod&lt;/a&gt; that
stores and distributes simple textual data using the Domain Name System. It is
typically used in local environments as a stand-in for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol&quot;&gt;LDAP&lt;/a&gt;.
The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CH&lt;/code&gt; class is reserved for something called Chaosnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the world belongs to TCP/IP. Those two protocols (together with UDP)
govern most of the remote communication that happens between computers. But I
think it&apos;s wonderful that you can still find, hidden in the plumbing of the
internet, traces of this other, long-extinct, evocatively named system. What
was Chaosnet? And why did it go the way of the dinosaurs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Machine Room at MIT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaosnet was developed in the 1970s by researchers at the MIT Artificial
Intelligence Lab. It was created as a part of a larger effort to design and
build a machine that could run the Lisp programming language more efficiently
than a general-purpose computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisp was the brainchild of MIT professor John McCarthy, who pioneered the field
of artificial intelligence. He first described Lisp to the world in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf&quot;&gt;a
paper&lt;/a&gt; published in 1960. By
1962, an interpreter and a compiler had been written. Lisp introduced an
astounding number of features that today we consider standard for many
programming languages. It was the first language to have a garbage collector.
It was the first to have a REPL. And it was the first to support dynamic
typing. It found favor among programmers working in artificial intelligence
and—to name just one example—was used to develop the famous
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU&quot;&gt;SHRDLU&lt;/a&gt; demonstration, which allowed
a human to dictate simple actions involving toy blocks to a computer in natural
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Lisp was that it could be slow. Simple operations could take
twice as long to execute as was typical with other languages because Lisp
variables were type-checked at runtime and not just during compilation. Lisp&apos;s
garbage collector was known to take up to an entire second to run on the IBM
7090 at MIT.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These performance issues were especially unwelcome because the
AI researchers using Lisp were trying to build applications like SHRDLU that
interacted with users in real time. In the late 1970s, a group of MIT
Artificial Intelligence Lab researchers decided to address these problems by
building machines specifically designed to run Lisp programs. These &quot;Lisp
machines&quot; had more memory and a compact instruction set better-suited to Lisp.
Type-checking would be done by dedicated circuitry, speeding it up by orders of
magnitude. And unlike most computer systems at the time, Lisp machines would
not be time-shared, since ambitious Lisp programs needed all the resources a
computer had available. Each user would be assigned his or her own CPU. In a
memo, the Lisp Machine Group at MIT described how this would make Lisp
programming significantly easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lisp Machine is a personal computer. Personal computing means that the
processor and main memory are not time-division multiplexed, instead each
person gets his own. The personal computation system consists of a pool of
processors, each with its own main memory, and its own disk for swapping.
When a user logs in, he is assigned a processor, and he has exclusive use of
it for the duration of the session. When he logs out, the processor is
returned to the pool, for the next person to use. This way, there is no
competition from other users for memory; the pages the user is frequently
referring to remain in core, and so swapping overhead is considerably
reduced. Thus the Lisp Machine solves a basic problem of the time-sharing
Lisp system.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lisp machine would be a personal computer in a different sense than the one
we think of today. As the Lisp Machine Group originally envisioned it, users
would sit down in their offices not in front of their own Lisp machines but in
front of terminals. The terminals would be connected to the actual Lisp
machine, which would be elsewhere. Even though each user would be assigned his
or her own processor, the processors would still be &quot;kept off in a machine
room,&quot; since they would make noise and take up space and thus be &quot;unwelcome
office companions.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The processors would share access to a file system and
to devices like printers via a high-speed local network &quot;with completely
distributed control.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That network was Chaosnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaosnet is both a hardware standard and a software protocol. The hardware
standard resembles Ethernet, and in fact the Chaosnet software protocol was
eventually run over Ethernet. The software protocol, which specifies both
network-layer and transport-layer interactions, was, unlike TCP/IP, always
meant to govern a &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; network. In another memo released by the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Lab, David Moon, a member of the Lisp Machine Group,
explained that Chaosnet &quot;contains no special provisions for things such as
low-speed links, noisy links, multiple paths, and long-distance links with
significant transit time.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The focus was instead on designing a protocol
that could outperform other protocols on a small network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed was important because Chaosnet sat between each Lisp processor and
the file system. Network delays would significantly slow rudimentary operations
like viewing the contents of a text document. To be fast enough, Chaosnet
incorporated several improvements over the Network Control Program then in use
on Arpanet. According to Moon, &quot;it was important to design out bottlenecks such
as are found in Arpanet, for instance the control-link which is shared between
multiple connections and the need to acknowledge each message before the next
message is sent.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Chaosnet protocol batches packet acknowledgments in
much the same way that TCP does today and so reduced the number of packets that
needed to be transmitted by a half to a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaosnet could also get away with a relatively simple routing algorithm, since
most hosts on the Lisp machine network were probably connected by a single,
short wire. Moon wrote that the Chaosnet routing scheme &quot;is predicated on the
assumption that the network geometry is simple, there are few multiple paths,
and the length of any path is quite short. This makes more sophisticated
schemes unnecessary.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The simplicity of the algorithm meant that
implementing the Chaosnet protocol was easy. The implementation program was
supposedly half the size of the Arpanet Network Control Program.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chaosnet protocol has other idiosyncrasies. A Chaosnet address is only 16
bits, half the size of an IPv4 address, which makes sense given that Chaosnet
was only ever meant to work on a local network. Chaosnet also doesn&apos;t use port
numbers; instead, a process that wants to connect to another process on a
different machine first makes a connection request that specifies a target
&quot;contact name.&quot; That contact name is often just the name of a particular
service. For example, one host may try to connect to another host using the
contact name &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TELNET&lt;/code&gt;. In practice, I assume this works more or less just like
TCP, since something well-known like port 80 might as well have the contact
name &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chaosnet DNS class was added to the Domain Name System by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc973&quot;&gt;RFC
973&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. It replaced another class
that had been available early on, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CSNET&lt;/code&gt; class, which was there to support
a network called the Computer Science Network. I haven&apos;t been able to figure
out why Chaosnet was picked out for special treatment by the Domain Name
System. There were other protocol families that could have been added but never
were. For example, Paul Mockapetris, one of the principal architects of the
Domain Name System, has written that he originally imagined that DNS would
include a class for Xerox&apos;s network protocol.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That never happened.
Chaosnet may have been added just because so much of the early work on Arpanet
and the internet happened at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, whose employees were often connected in some way with MIT.
Chaosnet was probably well-known among the then relatively small group of
people working on computer networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage of Chaosnet presumably waned as Lisp machines became less and less
popular. Though Lisp machines were for a short time commercially viable
products—sold by companies such as Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc. during the
1980s—they were soon displaced by cheaper microcomputers that could run Lisp
just as quickly without special-purpose circuitry. TCP/IP also fixed many
of the issues with the original Arpanet protocols that Chaosnet had been
created to circumvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There unfortunately isn&apos;t a huge amount of information still around about
Chaosnet. RFC 675, which was essentially the first draft of TCP/IP, was
published in 1974. Chaosnet was first developed in 1975.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; TCP/IP eventually
conquered the world, but Chaosnet seems to have been a technological dead end.
Though it&apos;s possible that Chaosnet influenced subsequent work on TCP/IP, I
haven&apos;t found any specific examples of that happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only really visible remnant of Chaosnet is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CH&lt;/code&gt; DNS class. There&apos;s
something about that fact that I find strangely fascinating. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CH&lt;/code&gt; class is
a vestigial ghost of an alternative network protocol in a world that has long
since settled on TCP/IP. It&apos;s exciting, at least to me, to know that the last
traces of Chaosnet still lurk out there in the infrastructure of our networked
society. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CH&lt;/code&gt; DNS class is a fun artifact of digital archaeology. But it&apos;s
also a living reminder that the internet was not born fully formed, that TCP/IP
is not the only way to connect computers to each other, and that &quot;the internet&quot;
is far from the coolest name we could have had for our global communication
system.&lt;/p&gt;

The first is a story about a vision of the web&apos;s
future that never quite came to fruition. The second is a story about how a
collaborative effort to improve a popular standard devolved into one of the
most contentious forks in the history of open-source software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, in the go-go years between Netscape&apos;s IPO and the Dot-com
crash, everyone could see that the web was going to be an even bigger deal
than it already was, even if they didn&apos;t know exactly how it was going to get
there. One theory was that the web was about to be revolutionized by
syndication. The web, originally built to enable a simple transaction between
two parties—a client fetching a document from a single host server—would be
broken open by new standards that could be used to repackage and redistribute
entire websites through a variety of channels. Kevin Werbach, writing for
&lt;em&gt;Release 1.0&lt;/em&gt;, a newsletter influential among investors in the 1990s, predicted
that syndication &quot;would evolve into the core model for the Internet economy,
allowing businesses and individuals to retain control over their online
personae while enjoying the benefits of massive scale and scope.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He
invited his readers to imagine a future in which fencing aficionados, rather
than going directly to an &quot;online sporting goods site&quot; or &quot;fencing equipment
retailer,&quot; could buy a new épée directly through e-commerce widgets embedded
into their favorite website about fencing.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Just like in the television
world, where big networks syndicate their shows to smaller local stations,
syndication on the web would allow businesses and publications to reach
consumers through a multitude of intermediary sites. This would mean, as a
corollary, that consumers would gain significant control over where and how
they interacted with any given business or publication on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS was one of the standards that promised to deliver this syndicated future.
To Werbach, RSS was &quot;the leading example of a lightweight syndication
protocol.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another contemporaneous article called RSS the first protocol to
realize the potential of XML.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was going to be a way for both users and
content aggregators to create their own customized channels out of everything
the web had to offer. And yet, two decades later, RSS &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;#x26;geo=US&amp;#x26;q=rss&quot;&gt;appears to be a dying
technology&lt;/a&gt;,
now used chiefly by podcasters and programmers with tech blogs. Moreover,
among that latter group, RSS is perhaps used as much for its political
symbolism as its actual utility. Though of course some people really do have
RSS readers, stubbornly adding an RSS feed to your blog, even in 2018, is a
reactionary statement. That little tangerine bubble has become a wistful symbol
of defiance against a centralized web increasingly controlled by a handful of
corporations, a web that hardly resembles the syndicated web of Werbach&apos;s
imagining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future once looked so bright for RSS. What happened? Was its downfall
inevitable, or was it precipitated by the bitter infighting that thwarted the
development of a single RSS standard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muddied Water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS was invented twice. This meant it never had an obvious owner, a state of
affairs that spawned endless debate and acrimony. But it also suggests that RSS
was an important idea whose time had come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Netscape was struggling to envision a future for itself. Its flagship
product, the Netscape Navigator web browser—once preferred by 80% of web
users—was quickly losing ground to Internet Explorer. So Netscape decided to
compete in a new arena. In May, a team was brought together to start work on
what was known internally as &quot;Project 60.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Two months later, Netscape
announced &quot;My Netscape,&quot; a web portal that would fight it out with other
portals like Yahoo, MSN, and Excite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year, in March, Netscape announced an addition to the My Netscape
portal called the &quot;My Netscape Network.&quot; My Netscape users could now customize
their My Netscape page so that it contained &quot;channels&quot; featuring the most
recent headlines from sites around the web. As long as your favorite website
published a special file in a format dictated by Netscape, you could add that
website to your My Netscape page, typically by clicking an &quot;Add Channel&quot; button
that participating websites were supposed to add to their interfaces. A little
box containing a list of linked headlines would then appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/mnn-channel.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A My Netscape Network Channel&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special file that participating websites had to publish was an RSS file. In
the My Netscape Network announcement, Netscape explained that RSS stood for
&quot;RDF Site Summary.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was somewhat of a misnomer. RDF, or the Resource
Description Framework, is basically a grammar for describing certain properties
of arbitrary resources. (See &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/semantic-web&quot;&gt;my article about the Semantic Web&lt;/a&gt;
if that sounds really exciting to you.)
In 1999, a draft specification for RDF was being considered by the W3C. Though
RSS was supposed to be based on RDF, the example RSS document Netscape actually
released didn&apos;t use any RDF tags at all, even if it declared the RDF XML
namespace. In a document that accompanied the Netscape RSS specification, Dan
Libby, one of the specification&apos;s authors, explained that &quot;in this release of
MNN, Netscape has intentionally limited the complexity of the RSS format.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The specification was given the 0.90 version number, the idea being that
subsequent versions would bring RSS more in line with the W3C&apos;s XML
specification and the evolving draft of the RDF specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS had been cooked up by Libby and another Netscape employee, Ramanathan
Guha. Guha previously worked for Apple, where he came up with something called
the Meta Content Framework. MCF was a format for representing metadata about
anything from web pages to local files. Guha demonstrated its power by
developing an application called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/19970703020212/http://mcf.research.apple.com:80/hs/screen_shot.html&quot;&gt;HotSauce&lt;/a&gt;
that visualized relationships between files as a network of nodes suspended in
3D space. After leaving Apple for Netscape, Guha worked with a Netscape
consultant named Tim Bray to produce an XML-based version of MCF, which in turn
became the foundation for the W3C&apos;s RDF draft.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It&apos;s no surprise, then,
that Guha and Libby were keen to incorporate RDF into RSS. But Libby later
wrote that the original vision for an RDF-based RSS was pared back because of
time constraints and the perception that RDF was &quot;&apos;too complex&apos; for the
&apos;average user.&apos;&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-11&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Netscape was trying to win eyeballs in what became known as the &quot;portal
wars,&quot; elsewhere on the web a new phenomenon known as &quot;weblogging&quot; was being
pioneered.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-12&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One of these pioneers was Dave Winer, CEO of a company called
UserLand Software, which developed early content management systems that made
blogging accessible to people without deep technical fluency. Winer ran his own
blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, which today is one of the oldest
blogs on the internet. More than a year before Netscape announced My Netscape
Network, on December 15th, 1997, Winer published a post announcing that the
blog would now be available in XML as well as HTML.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-13&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Winer&apos;s XML format became known as the Scripting News format. It was
supposedly similar to Microsoft&apos;s Channel Definition Format (a &quot;push
technology&quot; standard submitted to the W3C in March, 1997), but I haven&apos;t been
able to find a file in the original format to verify that claim.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-14&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Like
Netscape&apos;s RSS, it structured the content of Winer&apos;s blog so that it could be
understood by other software applications. When Netscape released RSS 0.90,
Winer and UserLand Software began to support both formats. But Winer believed
that Netscape&apos;s format was &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; and &quot;missing the key thing web
writers and readers need.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-15&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It could only represent a list of links,
whereas the Scripting News format could represent a series of paragraphs, each
containing one or more links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, 1999, two months after Netscape&apos;s My Netscape Network announcement,
Winer introduced a new version of the Scripting News format, called
ScriptingNews 2.0b1. Winer claimed that he decided to move ahead with his own
format only after trying but failing to get anyone at Netscape to care about
RSS 0.90&apos;s deficiencies.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-16&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The new version of the Scripting News format
added several items to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element that brought the Scripting News
format to parity with RSS. But the two formats continued to differ in that the
Scripting News format, which Winer nicknamed the &quot;fat&quot; syndication format,
could include entire paragraphs and not just links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netscape got around to releasing RSS 0.91 the very next month. The updated
specification was a major about-face. RSS no longer stood for &quot;RDF Site
Summary&quot;; it now stood for &quot;Rich Site Summary.&quot; All the RDF—and there was
almost none anyway—was stripped out. Many of the Scripting News tags were
incorporated. In the text of the new specification, Libby explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RDF references removed. RSS was originally conceived as a metadata format
providing a summary of a website. Two things have become clear: the first is
that providers want more of a syndication format than a metadata format. The
structure of an RDF file is very precise and must conform to the RDF data
model in order to be valid. This is not easily human-understandable and can
make it difficult to create useful RDF files. The second is that few tools
are available for RDF generation, validation and processing. For these
reasons, we have decided to go with a standard XML approach.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-17&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winer was enormously pleased with RSS 0.91, calling it &quot;even better than I
thought it would be.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-18&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; UserLand Software adopted it as a replacement for
the existing ScriptingNews 2.0b1 format. For a while, it seemed that RSS
finally had a single authoritative specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Great Fork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, the RSS 0.91 specification had become woefully inadequate. There
were all sorts of things people were trying to do with RSS that the
specification did not address. There were other parts of the specification that
seemed unnecessarily constraining—each RSS channel could only contain a maximum
of 15 items, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that point, RSS had been adopted by several more organizations. Other
than Netscape, which seemed to have lost interest after RSS 0.91, the big
players were Dave Winer&apos;s UserLand Software; O&apos;Reilly Net, which ran an RSS
aggregator called Meerkat; and Moreover.com, which also ran an RSS aggregator
focused on news.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-19&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Via mailing list, representatives from these
organizations and others regularly discussed how to improve on RSS 0.91. But
there were deep disagreements about what those improvements should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mailing list in which most of the discussion occurred was called the
Syndication mailing list. &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/syndication/info&quot;&gt;An archive of the Syndication mailing
list&lt;/a&gt; is still available.
It is an amazing historical resource. It provides a moment-by-moment account of
how those deep disagreements eventually led to a political rupture of the RSS
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side of the coming rupture was Winer. Winer was impatient to evolve RSS,
but he wanted to change it only in relatively conservative ways. In June, 2000,
he published his own RSS 0.91 specification on the UserLand website, meant to
be a starting point for further development of RSS. It made no significant
changes to the 0.91 specification published by Netscape. Winer claimed in a
blog post that accompanied his specification that it was only a &quot;cleanup&quot;
documenting how RSS was actually being used in the wild, which was needed
because the Netscape specification was no longer being maintained.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-20&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the
same post, he argued that RSS had succeeded so far because it was simple, and
that by adding namespaces or RDF back to the format—some had suggested this be
done in the Syndication mailing list—it &quot;would become vastly more complex, and
IMHO, at the content provider level, would buy us almost nothing for the added
complexity.&quot; In a message to the Syndication mailing list sent around the same
time, Winer suggested that these issues were important enough that they might
lead him to create a fork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m still pondering how to move RSS forward. I definitely want ICE-like
stuff in RSS2, publish and subscribe is at the top of my list, but I am
going to fight tooth and nail for simplicity. I love optional elements. I
don&apos;t want to go down the namespaces and schema road, or try to make it a
dialect of RDF. I understand other people want to do this, and therefore I
guess we&apos;re going to get a fork. I have my own opinion about where the other
fork will lead, but I&apos;ll keep those to myself for the moment at least.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-21&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrayed against Winer were several other people, including Rael Dornfest of
O&apos;Reilly, Ian Davis (responsible for a search startup called Calaba), and a
precocious, 14-year-old Aaron Swartz, who all thought that RSS needed
namespaces in order to accommodate the many different things everyone wanted to
do with it. On another mailing list hosted by O&apos;Reilly, Davis proposed a
namespace-based module system, writing that such a system would &quot;make RSS as
extensible as we like rather than packing in new features that over-complicate
the spec.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-22&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The &quot;namespace camp&quot; believed that RSS would soon be used for
much more than the syndication of blog posts, so namespaces, rather than being
a complication, were the only way to keep RSS from becoming unmanageable as it
supported more and more use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the root of this disagreement about namespaces was a deeper disagreement
about what RSS was even for. Winer had invented his Scripting News format to
syndicate the posts he wrote for his blog. Guha and Libby at Netscape had
designed RSS and called it &quot;RDF Site Summary&quot; because in their minds it was a
way of recreating a site in miniature within Netscape&apos;s online portal. Davis,
writing to the Syndication mailing list, explained his view that RSS was
&quot;originally conceived as a way of building mini sitemaps,&quot; and that now he and
others wanted to expand RSS &quot;to encompass more types of information than simple
news headlines and to cater for the new uses of RSS that have emerged over the
last 12 months.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-23&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-23&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Winer wrote a prickly reply, stating that his Scripting
News format was in fact the original RSS and that it had been meant for a
different purpose. Given that the people most involved in the development of
RSS disagreed about why RSS had even been created, a fork seems to have been
inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fork happened after Dornfest announced a proposed RSS 1.0 specification and
formed the RSS-DEV Working Group—which would include Davis, Swartz, and several
others but not Winer—to get it ready for publication. In the proposed
specification, RSS once again stood for &quot;RDF Site Summary,&quot; because RDF had had
been added back in to represent metadata properties of certain RSS elements.
The specification acknowledged Winer by name, giving him credit for
popularizing RSS through his &quot;evangelism.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-24&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-24&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But it also argued that just
adding more elements to RSS without providing for extensibility with a module
system—that is, what Winer was suggesting—&quot;sacrifices scalability.&quot; The
specification went on to define a module system for RSS based on XML
namespaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winer was furious that the RSS-DEV Working Group had arrogated the &quot;RSS 1.0&quot;
name for themselves.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-25&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-25&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In another mailing list about decentralization, he
described what the RSS-DEV Working Group had done as theft.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-26&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-26&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Other members
of the Syndication mailing list also felt that the RSS-DEV Working Group should
not have used the name &quot;RSS&quot; without unanimous agreement from the community on
how to move RSS forward. But the Working Group stuck with the name. Dan
Brickley, another member of the RSS-DEV Working Group, defended this decision
by arguing that &quot;RSS 1.0 as proposed is solidly grounded in the original RSS
vision, which itself had a long heritage going back to MCF (an RDF precursor)
and related specs (CDF etc).&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-27&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-27&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He essentially felt that the RSS 1.0 effort
had a better claim to the RSS name than Winer did, since RDF had originally
been a part of RSS. The RSS-DEV Working Group published a final version of
their specification in December. That same month, Winer published his own
improvement to RSS 0.91, which he called RSS 0.92, on UserLand&apos;s website. RSS
0.92 made several small optional improvements to RSS, among which was the
addition of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;enclosure&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag soon used by podcasters everywhere. RSS had
officially forked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not clear to me why a better effort was not made to involve Winer in the
RSS-DEV Working Group. He was a prominent contributor to the Syndication
mailing list and obviously responsible for much of RSS&apos; popularity, as the
members of the Working Group themselves acknowledged. But Tim O&apos;Reilly, founder
and CEO of O&apos;Reilly, explained in a UserLand discussion group that Winer more
or less refused to participate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of people involved in RSS got together to start thinking about its
future evolution. Dave was part of the group. When the consensus of the group
turned in a direction he didn&apos;t like, Dave stopped participating, and
characterized it as a plot by O&apos;Reilly to take over RSS from him, despite the
fact that Rael Dornfest of O&apos;Reilly was only one of about a dozen authors of
the proposed RSS 1.0 spec, and that many of those who were part of its
development had at least as long a history with RSS as Dave had.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-28&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-28&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this, Winer said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met with Dale [Dougherty] two weeks before the announcement, and he didn&apos;t
say anything about it being called RSS 1.0. I spoke on the phone with Rael
the Friday before it was announced, again he didn&apos;t say that they were
calling it RSS 1.0. The first I found out about it was when it was publicly
announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me ask you a straight question. If it turns out that the plan to call the
new spec &quot;RSS 1.0&quot; was done in private, without any heads-up or consultation,
or for a chance for the Syndication list members to agree or disagree, not
just me, what are you going to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UserLand did a lot of work to create and popularize and support RSS. We
walked away from that, and let your guys have the name. That&apos;s the top level.
If I want to do any further work in Web syndication, I have to use a
different name. Why and how did that happen Tim?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-29&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-29&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not been able to find a discussion in the Syndication mailing list about
using the RSS 1.0 name prior to the announcement of the RSS 1.0 proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS would fork again in 2003, when several developers frustrated with the
bickering in the RSS community sought to create an entirely new format.
These developers created Atom, a format that did away with RDF but embraced XML
namespaces. Atom would eventually be specified by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287&quot;&gt;a proposed IETF
standard&lt;/a&gt;. After the introduction of Atom,
there were three competing versions of RSS: Winer&apos;s RSS 0.92 (updated to RSS
2.0 in 2002 and renamed &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot;), the RSS-DEV Working
Group&apos;s RSS 1.0, and Atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of competing RSS specifications may have hampered RSS in
other ways that I&apos;ll discuss shortly. But it did not stop RSS from becoming
enormously popular during the 2000s. By 2004, the New York Times had started
offering its headlines in RSS and had written an article explaining to the
layperson what RSS was and how to use it.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-30&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-30&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Google Reader, an RSS aggregator
ultimately used by millions, was launched in 2005. By 2013, RSS seemed
popular enough that the New York Times, in its obituary for Aaron Swartz,
called the technology &quot;ubiquitous.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-31&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-31&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For a while, before a third of the
planet had signed up for Facebook, RSS was simply how many people stayed
abreast of news on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times published Swartz&apos; obituary in January, 2013. By that point,
though, RSS had actually turned a corner and was well on its way to becoming
an obscure technology. Google Reader was shutdown in July, 2013, ostensibly
because user numbers had been falling &quot;over the years.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-32&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This prompted
several articles from various outlets declaring that RSS was dead. But people
had been declaring that RSS was dead for years, even before Google Reader&apos;s
shuttering. Steve Gillmor, writing for TechCrunch in May, 2009, advised that
&quot;it&apos;s time to get completely off RSS and switch to Twitter&quot; because &quot;RSS just
doesn&apos;t cut it anymore.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-33&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He pointed out that Twitter was basically a
better RSS feed, since it could show you what people thought about an article
in addition to the article itself. It allowed you to follow people and not just
channels. Gillmor told his readers that it was time to let RSS recede into the
background. He ended his article with a verse from Bob Dylan&apos;s &quot;Forever Young.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, RSS is not dead. But neither is it anywhere near as popular as it once
was. Lots of people have offered explanations for why RSS lost its broad
appeal. Perhaps the most persuasive explanation is exactly the one offered by
Gillmor in 2009. Social networks, just like RSS, provide a feed featuring
all the latest news on the internet. Social networks took over from RSS because
they were simply better feeds. They also provide more benefits to the companies
that own them. Some people have accused Google, for example, of shutting down
Google Reader in order to encourage people to use Google+. Google might have
been able to monetize Google+ in a way that it could never have monetized
Google Reader. Marco Arment, the creator of Instapaper, wrote on his blog in
2013:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Reader is just the latest casualty of the war that Facebook started,
seemingly accidentally: the battle to own everything. While Google did
technically “own” Reader and could make some use of the huge amount of news
and attention data flowing through it, it conflicted with their far more
important Google+ strategy: they need everyone reading and sharing everything
through Google+ so they can compete with Facebook for ad-targeting data, ad
dollars, growth, and relevance.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-34&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So both users and technology companies realized that they got more out of using
social networks than they did out of RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theory is that RSS was always too geeky for regular people. Even the
New York Times, which seems to have been eager to adopt RSS and promote it to
its audience, complained in 2006 that RSS is a &quot;not particularly user friendly&quot;
acronym coined by &quot;computer geeks.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-35&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Before the RSS icon was designed in
2004, websites like the New York Times linked to their RSS feeds using little
orange boxes labeled &quot;XML,&quot; which can only have been intimidating.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-36&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
label was perfectly accurate though, because back then clicking the link would
take a hapless user to a page full of XML. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008&quot;&gt;This great
tweet&lt;/a&gt; captures the
essence of this explanation for RSS&apos; demise. Regular people never felt
comfortable using RSS; it hadn&apos;t really been designed as a consumer-facing
technology and involved too many hurdles; people jumped ship as soon as
something better came along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS might have been able to overcome some of these limitations if it had been
further developed. Maybe RSS could have been extended somehow so that
friends subscribed to the same channel could syndicate their thoughts about an
article to each other. But whereas a company like Facebook was able to &quot;move
fast and break things,&quot; the RSS developer community was stuck trying to achieve
consensus. The Great RSS Fork only demonstrates how difficult it was to do
that. So if we are asking ourselves why RSS is no longer popular, a good
first-order explanation is that social networks supplanted it. If we ask
ourselves why social networks were able to supplant it, then the answer may be
that the people trying to make RSS succeed faced a problem much harder than,
say, building Facebook. As Dornfest wrote to the Syndication mailing list
at one point, &quot;currently it&apos;s the politics far more than the serialization
that&apos;s far from simple.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-37&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-37&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today we are left with centralized silos of information. In a way, we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;
have the syndicated internet that Kevin Werbach foresaw in 1999. After all,
&lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt; is a publication that relies on syndication through Facebook and
Twitter the same way that Seinfeld relied on syndication to rake in millions
after the end of its original run. But syndication on the web only happens
through one of a very small number of channels, meaning that none of us &quot;retain
control over our online personae&quot; the way that Werbach thought we would. One
reason this happened is garden-variety corporate rapaciousness—RSS, an open
format, didn&apos;t give technology companies the control over data and eyeballs
that they needed to sell ads, so they did not support it. But the more mundane
reason is that centralized silos are just easier to design than common
standards. Consensus is difficult to achieve and it takes time, but without
consensus spurned developers will go off and create competing standards. The
lesson here may be that if we want to see a better, more open web, we have to
get better at not screwing each other over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; arrow &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.arrow&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; speed &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.speed-value&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;watchPosition&lt;/code&gt; to get the data. If the position data changes (either by device movement or if more accurate geo information arrives), you can set up a callback function that is called with that updated position information. This is done using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;watchPosition()&lt;/code&gt; function. The callback function is called multiple times, allowing the browser to either update your location as you move, or provide a more accurate location as different techniques are used to geolocate you. The error callback function, which is optional, can be called repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;navigator&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;geolocation&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;watchPosition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;err&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;err&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating the DOM elements with the position data -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// inside watchPosition&lt;/span&gt;
speed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;coords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;speed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
arrow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;transform &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`rotate(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;coords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;heading&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;deg)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes this exercise. The codepen (though I doubt this will work unless you&apos;re on a phone/tablet)&lt;/p&gt;

Today we learn how to make cool follow along link highlights in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/POP_qri7RA8&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codepen -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;444&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-22-LinkHighlight-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/OEoBRY/?height=444&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/OEoBRY/&apos;&gt;JS30-22-LinkHighlight-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a menu and some junk html with links interspersed. The idea is to create an highlight that moves from one link to another on hover, in a smooth animated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll achieve the highlight with an underlying &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;span.highlight&lt;/code&gt; element. The CSS for this is already given, it contains the transition property for animation effect -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.highlight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; all 0.2s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;2px solid white&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; absolute&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;white&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; -1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;20px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; block&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0 0 10px &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0,0,0,0.2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the element via JS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; highlight &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;span&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
highlight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;highlight&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;highlight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates an span element and adds the class &apos;highlight&apos; to it. Then appends the element to the end of the document body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to figure when there is an hover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; triggers &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;a&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
triggers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseenter&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; highlightLink&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;highlightLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;highlightLink()&lt;/code&gt; we need to move the span element exactly over the link we&apos;re hovering on. Due to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;z-index: -1&lt;/code&gt; on the highlight element, it moves under the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the position and dimensions of the link, we&apos;ll use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect()&lt;/code&gt;. This method returns the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport. The returned value is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;DOMRect&lt;/code&gt; object. The result is the smallest rectangle which contains the entire element, with left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, and height properties describing the overall border-box in pixels. Properties other than width and height are relative to the top-left of the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect&quot;&gt;MDN Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key thing to note here is that the top, left, right, bottom are all relative to the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;highlightLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; linkCoords &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;linkCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; coords &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//width and height are absolute&lt;/span&gt;
    width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; linkCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; linkCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// we need to add scroll since &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//top,left are relative to the viewport&lt;/span&gt;
    top&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; linkCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;top &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;scrollY&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    left&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; linkCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;scrollX
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  highlight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;coords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  highlight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;coords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  highlight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;transform &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`translate(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;coords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;coords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We extract the dimensions and position of the link element we&apos;re hovering over and set the style of the highlight element to those dimensions and move it to that position. Since there is already a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transition: all 0.2s&lt;/code&gt; set in highlight&apos;s CSS, the change will appear animated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the final code -&lt;/p&gt;

Today we&apos;ll learn how to do speech synthesis (text to speech) with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/saCpKH_xdgs&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starter Code -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;474&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-23-SpeechSynthesis-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/GGXwyq/?height=474&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/GGXwyq/&apos;&gt;JS30-23-SpeechSynthesis-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speech synthesis is one half of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API&quot;&gt;Web Speech API&lt;/a&gt;, the other being the speech recognition API we dealt with earlier.
Speech synthesis is accessed via the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesis&lt;/code&gt; interface, a text-to-speech component that allows programs to read out their text content (normally via the device&apos;s default speech synthesizer.) Different voice types are represented by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesisVoice&lt;/code&gt; objects, and different parts of text that you want to be spoken are represented by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesisUtterance&lt;/code&gt; objects. You can get these spoken by passing them to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesis.speak()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we already have -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; msg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesisUtterance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; voices &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; voicesDropdown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;[name=&quot;voice&quot;]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; options &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;[type=&quot;range&quot;], [name=&quot;text&quot;]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; speakButton &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#speak&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; stopButton &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#stop&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have handles to the various DOM elements, and we have msg - a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesisUtterance&lt;/a&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesisUtterance&lt;/code&gt; represents a speech request. It contains the content the speech service should read and information about how to read it (e.g. language, pitch and volume.) The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesisUtterance&lt;/code&gt; object has various properties that can be set, to manipulate the speech generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.lang&lt;/code&gt; - Gets and sets the language of the utterance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.pitch&lt;/code&gt; - Gets and sets the pitch at which the utterance will be spoken at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.rate&lt;/code&gt;- Gets and sets the speed at which the utterance will be spoken at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.text&lt;/code&gt; - Gets and sets the text that will be synthesized when the utterance is spoken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.voice&lt;/code&gt; - Gets and sets the voice that will be used to speak the utterance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.volume&lt;/code&gt; - Gets and sets the volume that the utterance will be spoken at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most basic thing you need to do to generate speech -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; msg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesisUtterance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// .text should be set, all other properties have defaults&lt;/span&gt;
msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;text &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello There&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// speak() does the actual synthesis - uses default voice&lt;/span&gt;
speechSynthesis&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the various features of our app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get the default text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want the app to speak whatever text we have in the text area, so lets set the initial value of the msg text to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;text &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;[name=&quot;text&quot;]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Select a custom voice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the voice property - we use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;voiceschanged&lt;/code&gt; event to listen to when all the voices have been loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;populateVoices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// array of SpeechSynthesisVoice objects&lt;/span&gt;
  voices &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getVoices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  voicesDropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHTML &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; voices
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;voice &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lang&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;en&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;voice &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&amp;lt;option value=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;voice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;voice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;voice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lang&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;)&amp;lt;/option&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
speechSynthesis&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;voiceschanged&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; populateVoices&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the voices from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;speechSynthesis&lt;/code&gt; object, then filter only those which are english. Then create option tags (as strings) and add them to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; of the select component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when the user selects the voice, we want to change the utterance to use that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setVoice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;voice &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; voices&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;voice &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
voicesDropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;change&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; setVoice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We search through the array of voices to find the correct &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechSynthesisVoice&lt;/code&gt;. We then set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;msg.voice&lt;/code&gt; to that object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// A example SpeechSynthesisVoice object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; lang&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;en-IN&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  localService&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Veena&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  voiceURI&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Veena&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rate, pitch, user entered text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; variable is a NodeList of three elements, the rate, pitch &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; elements and the text area.
We can deal with all three inputs in one function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; options &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;[type=&quot;range&quot;], [name=&quot;text&quot;]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setOption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

options&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;option &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; option&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;change&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; setOption&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of each of the input elements match with the corresponding property name in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/code&gt;, and the value can be extracted in the same way using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.value&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start and stop the speech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a start and stop button already, let us write a function to be triggered on click&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;startOver &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  speechSynthesis&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cancel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;startOver&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    speechSynthesis&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
speakButton&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
stopButton&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;toggle()&lt;/code&gt; cancels anything that is already playing, and in case &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;startOver&lt;/code&gt; is true (viz the default case), then it replays the current text with the current settings. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;startOver&lt;/code&gt; is set to false in the stop button, so it doesn&apos;t start playing anything after is cancels the current speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll also use toggle in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setOption&lt;/code&gt; to re-start the speech after a change in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setOption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes our tiny app, here is the final code -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is what we&apos;ll be manipulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- heading before the nav --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- the nav bar --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- rest of the body --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;site-wrap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ... &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to figure out the distance of the nav bar from the top of the page, then when we&apos;ve scrolled to that point we need to change the CSS property of the nav to a fixed position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; nav &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#main&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; topOfNav &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; nav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetTop&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fixNav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;scroll&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; fixNav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;elem.offsetTop&lt;/code&gt; gives us the distance of the element in px. We listen to the scroll event and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fixNav()&lt;/code&gt; to check if the nav position should change. Instead of changing the style, we can just add a class on the body element itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.scrollY&lt;/code&gt; gives us the vertical scroll in px.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;body.fixed-nav nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; fixed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;0 5px 0 &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0,0,0,0.1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fixNav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;scrollY &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; topOfNav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;paddingTop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; nav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetHeight &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;px&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;fixed-nav&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;fixed-nav&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;paddingTop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the scroll us beyond the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;topNav&lt;/code&gt; position, then the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fixed-nav&lt;/code&gt; class is added. Else it is removed. As we see from the CSS fragment above, once the body has the class of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fixed-nav&lt;/code&gt;, the position of the nav is fixed (to the top) and there is also a box shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when you fix the position of an element, the space it occupies goes free for other elements to reflow into. Hence along with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fixed-nav&lt;/code&gt; class, we add and remove the padding &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;document.body.style.paddingTop&lt;/code&gt; equivalent to the height of the nav bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for a little more styling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.fixed-nav li.logo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;500px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;body.fixed-nav .site-wrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now along with the fixed nav bar, the logo animates into view and the text gets a little bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the final code -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;462&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-24-stickyNav-b&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/aKRypz/?height=442&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/aKRypz/&apos;&gt;JS30-24-stickyNav-b&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.

In this exercise we&apos;ll play with JS events - bubbling, capture and one time events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1anRyL37lE&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;376&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-25-Events-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/LrgJOZ/?height=376&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/LrgJOZ/&apos;&gt;JS30-25-Events-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll just be trying out different exercises to figure out how events in the browser work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML structure we&apos;ll be working with - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;one&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;two&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;three&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just three nested boxes. We&apos;ll select them in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;divs&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; divs &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;div&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bubbling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bubbles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bubbles &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

divs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; div&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; bubbles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Output (after cliking on three)-&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;div class=​&quot;three&quot;&gt;​​&amp;lt;/div&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// bubbles  three&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;div class=​&quot;three&quot;&gt;​​&amp;lt;/div&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// bubbles  two&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;div class=​&quot;three&quot;&gt;​​&amp;lt;/div&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// bubbles  one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the target is always the third div (inner most box), but click is triggered for each div. This is due to bubbling - where the event bubbles up to the parent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capturing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;captures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;captures &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

divs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; div&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; captures&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;capture&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Output on cliking div.three&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;div class=​&quot;three&quot;&gt;​​&amp;lt;/div&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// captures  one&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;div class=​&quot;three&quot;&gt;​​&amp;lt;/div&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// captures  two&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;div class=​&quot;three&quot;&gt;​​&amp;lt;/div&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// captures  three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again the target is always the div we&apos;ve clicked on, but click is triggered on each of the boxes starting from the parent box this time! This is what setting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{capture:true}&lt;/code&gt; will do. So instead of bubbling there is capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that events still work the same in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event goes from parent to child in a phase called as &apos;capture&apos; and then
from the target child all the way up to the window in a phase known as &apos;bubbling&apos;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s just that setting capture to true in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;addEventListener()&lt;/code&gt; will trigger the callback
during the capture phase rather than the default bubbling phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;logAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    phase &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;unknown&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;capture&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;target&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bubbling&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;phase&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;eventPhase&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// same handler for both phases, we log the event phase in the handler&lt;/span&gt;
divs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; div&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; logAll&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
divs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; div&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; logAll&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;capture&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Output on clicking div.three&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// capture one&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// capture two&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// target three&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// target three&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// bubbling two&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// bubbling one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the above example helps you visualize what is happening! The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;phase&lt;/code&gt; object is derived from the phase to number mapping on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/eventPhase&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stop Propagation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Event.stopPropagation()&lt;/code&gt; Prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;logEv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stopPropagation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

divs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; div&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; logEv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//Output (without e.stopPropagation())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// three&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// two&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// one&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// After adding e.stopPropagation()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is no longer bubbled. The effect will be similar if done during the capture phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trigger once&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we want an event to trigger only once,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;runOnce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;I should run only once&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
divs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; div&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; runOnce&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;once&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.three&lt;/code&gt; you&apos;ll see &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I should run only once&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; logged thrice (once per parent), which means it is called the first time. Click it again and nothing happens. Even if you click &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.one&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.two&lt;/code&gt;, nothing happens! This is because the callbacks have already run once even though they were not the target!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes this exercise, I&apos;m not adding a final codepen as it&apos;s simpler to just open your console and test this out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stripe nav]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the 26th project of Wes Bos's  JS30 series .

&lt;p&gt;Starter Code -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have quite a bit of HTML and CSS given to us, but luckily we don&apos;t have to modify any of those, just write the JS bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML we interact with is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nav.top&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;dropdownBackground&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;arrow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- nav bar which we see --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;cool&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- about me --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Courses --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- other links --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.dropdownBackground&lt;/code&gt; is the white background you see behind the nav dropdown when you hover over them. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ul.cool&lt;/code&gt; contains the actual nav items, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s corresponds to the &apos;about me&apos;, &apos;courses&apos; and &apos;other links&apos; items. Just for completeness let&apos;s have a look at a single nav element&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;#&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;About Me&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;dropdown dropdown1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;bio&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;https://logo.clearbit.com/wesbos.com&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wes Bos sure does love web development. He teaches things like JavaScript, CSS and BBQ. Wait. BBQ isn&apos;t part of web development. It should be though!&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each element has a link tag with the text you see on the nav, and below that is the dropdown content. The dropdown content (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.dropdown&lt;/code&gt;) should become visible when you hover over the corresponding &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. The dropdown has &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;display:none, opacity:0&lt;/code&gt;, when the user hovers over the item it animates into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&apos;s breakdown the steps required to achieve the effect -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get all the handles to the DOM elements we wish to manipulate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track mouse enter and leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show dropdown elements on mouse enter/leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the background highlight, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the width of the highlight to match the dropdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the position to fit behind the dropdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get handle on DOM elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; triggers &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.cool &gt; li&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; background  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.dropdownBackground&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; nav  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.top&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Track mouse enter and leave&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleEnter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleLeave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
triggers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;trigger &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; trigger&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseenter&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleEnter&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
triggers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;trigger &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; trigger&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseleave&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleLeave&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mouseenter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mouseleave&lt;/code&gt; event listeners on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements since we don&apos;t want to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Show dropdown on mouse enter/leave&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter-active&lt;/code&gt; CSS classes to get our desired effect. These classes are added to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements holding the dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.trigger-enter .dropdown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; block&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.trigger-enter-active .dropdown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll add &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter-active&lt;/code&gt; 150ms after adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter&lt;/code&gt; since we can&apos;t animate display and opacity at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleEnter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;trigger-enter&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;trigger-enter-active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleLeave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;trigger-enter&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;trigger-enter-active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point if you hover over the nav elements real quick you&apos;ll see that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter-active&lt;/code&gt; class remains even after you&apos;re no longer hovering on the element. This is because &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter&lt;/code&gt; is initially set, then you immediately move out (before 150ms) so &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;handleLeave&lt;/code&gt; removes the trigger classes, only then is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter-active&lt;/code&gt; set (the initial 150ms callback)! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can fix this in handle enter by changing the callback to -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;trigger-enter&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;trigger-enter-active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the callback check whether the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter&lt;/code&gt; class exists, only then does it add &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;trigger-enter-active&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Show the background highlight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.dropdownBackground&lt;/code&gt; element add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; class to make it visible, remove it to make it disappear! Open just makes the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;opacity : 1&lt;/code&gt;, which is otherwise zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// in handleEnter()&lt;/span&gt;
background&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;open&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// in handleLeave&lt;/span&gt;
background&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;open&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change the width of highlight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleEnter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//....&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; dropdown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.dropdown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; dropdownCoords &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dropdownCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dropdownCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width

    background&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;width&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;width&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    background&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;height&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;height&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;elem.getBoundingClientRect()&lt;/code&gt; gives us the dimensions and position of the element. The dimensions are absolute and the positions are relative.
We get the dimensions of the dropdown corresponding to the element we&apos;re hovering over (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;) and then set the dimensions of our background to the same value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change the position&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleEnter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ....&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; navCoords &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; nav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; top &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dropdownCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;top &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; navCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;top
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; left &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dropdownCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; navCoords&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left
    background&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;transform&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`translate(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;left&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we subtract &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s top and left value as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect()&lt;/code&gt; returns position values that are relative to the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That completes this exercise! Here is the final codepen -&lt;/p&gt;

Today we make a pretty neat click and drag to scroll interface where you will learn a whole lot about JavaScript events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9EWifQ5xqA&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starter code -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;463&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-27-ClickDrag-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/mKQVXw/?height=363&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=css,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/mKQVXw/&apos;&gt;JS30-27-ClickDrag-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll be scrolling horizontally the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.items&lt;/code&gt; list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;item item1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;01&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;item item2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;02&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    ...
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t worry about the CSS, it just positions the items, adds perspective and color. We won&apos;t be needing that for our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps to reach our desired effect -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect mouse events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get initial data (is clicked, initial x, initial Y scroll)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track drag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the scroll position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Detect mouse events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to detect the drag only on the items div. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mousedown&lt;/code&gt; we detect the click, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mouseup&lt;/code&gt; to detect the release of the click. We only want to detect &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mousemove&lt;/code&gt; when the mouse has been clicked inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.items&lt;/code&gt;. So when the user moves out of the items div, we set &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isDown&lt;/code&gt; to false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; slider &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.items&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// isDown checks if we have an active click&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; isDown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousedown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousedown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; isDown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseleave&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseleave&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; isDown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseup&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseup&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; isDown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousemove&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;isDown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousemove - drag&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//logs only if there is a drag&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; class to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.items&lt;/code&gt; when the drag is enabled (i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isDown == true&lt;/code&gt;). The class highlights the background a little bit, changes the cursor, and makes the element slightly bigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get initial data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment the user clicks anywhere on the slider, we record the current X position (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.pageX&lt;/code&gt;) and the current Y scroll (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scrollLeft&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; startX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; scrollLeft&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousedown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    isDown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    startX &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pageX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    scrollLeft &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;scrollLeft&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These values will be useful to move the scroll when there is a drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Track the drag and update scroll&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousemove&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;isDown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
    slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;scrollLeft &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; scrollLeft &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pageX &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; startX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; call to stop the default behavior, such as text selection.
Now if we drag the mouse to the left in the slider, we want the items to move left as well, for this to happen the scroll should move right. Let&apos;s keep it simple and say if we drag 25px left, we want the scroll to move 25px right. (You can later change the sensitivity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.pageX&lt;/code&gt; gives the new x-position, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;startX&lt;/code&gt; gives us the initial x-position before the drag began. Subtracting that would give us the distance moved horizontally. We then subtract the delta (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.pageX - startX&lt;/code&gt;) from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scrollLeft&lt;/code&gt;. We would have added the delta if we wanted the scroll to move in the direction of the mouse drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can adjust the sensitivity by multiplying the delta with a positive number greater than 1. Eg. for 2x sensitivity : &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(e.pageX - startX) * 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the final code - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll be building a video speed controller where the user can control the video speed just by hovering the mouse over the controller bar. This will be a mixture of various things we&apos;ve dealt before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML we have &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;wrapper&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;speed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;speed-bar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1×&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.flex&lt;/code&gt; is the video element whose playback rate we&apos;ll change, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.speed&lt;/code&gt; element is the speed controller and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.speed-bar&lt;/code&gt; is the current playback speed indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s select all the DOM elements we&apos;ll use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; speed &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.speed&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; bar &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; speed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.speed-bar&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; video &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;video&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//min, max playback speed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; min &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; max &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to mouse move on the speed controller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;speed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousemove&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleMove&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;handleMove&lt;/code&gt; function does two things - changes the height of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.speed-bar&lt;/code&gt; and changes the playback rate of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changing the speed bar height&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleMove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pageY &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetTop
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; percent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetHeight
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;percent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;%&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  bar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; height
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the y value of the mouse within the speed controller. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;y = e.pageY - this.offsetTop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the fraction which it represents, i.e. y value / total height. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;percent = y / this.offsetHeight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the height in %, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;height = Math.round(percent * 100) + &amp;#39;%&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;speed-bar&lt;/code&gt; to that height. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bar.style.height = height&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changing the playback rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// in handleMove()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; playbackRate &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; percent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;max &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
bar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; playbackRate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toFixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;×&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;playbackRate &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; playbackRate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the playback rate we map the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;percentage&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; range, and add the min offset. That is how we get &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;playbackRate = percent * (max - min) + min&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then just update the text in the speed bar and the playback rate of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes our exercise. The final codepen is below -&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the HTML display, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.timer__controls&lt;/code&gt; holds all the buttons and the form for custom entering the minutes. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-time&lt;/code&gt; attribute hold the time in seconds that the corresponding button sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h1.display__time-left&lt;/code&gt; is the countdown display, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;p.display__end-time&lt;/code&gt; displays the end time when the count down will run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may be initially tempted to just use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setInterval()&lt;/code&gt; and update the countdown, it&apos;ll work in most cases, but it isn&apos;t reliable. If the browser is minimized or if there are other computation heavy function blocking the event loop, the interval callback may not be called to the second. Hence we take a different approach. We&apos;ll have the callback check the remaining time by comparing to the current time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//handles to displays and controls&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; timerDisplay &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.display__time-left&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; endTime &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.display__end-time&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; buttons &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;[data-time]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; countdown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// this is the ret value if setInterval&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// clear any existing timers&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;countdown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; now &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Date&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// convert seconds to mili seconds&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; then &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; now &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;displayTimeLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  countdown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; secondsLeft &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;then &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Date&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// check if we should stop the countdown&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;secondsLeft &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;countdown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// else display secondsLeft&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;displayTimeLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;secondsLeft&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;displayTimeLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//display logic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well we did quite a few things here, lets see what we have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;timer(sec)&lt;/code&gt; function sets a timer for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sec&lt;/code&gt; seconds. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;now&lt;/code&gt; is the time (in mili seconds) the timer is being set, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; is the time when the timer will run out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt; which is supposed to run every second, even if the callback is missed, no issues since we&apos;re calculating the seconds left using the final time &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; and the time the callback runs. That&apos;s how we get &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;secondsLeft = Math.round((then - Date.now()) / 1000)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;displayTimeLeft&lt;/code&gt; with the initial number of seconds in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;timer()&lt;/code&gt;, then it is called in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt; callback to display &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;secondsLeft&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;secondsLeft&lt;/code&gt; gets lesser than zero, the interval is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the seconds left display logic -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;displayTimeLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; minutes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; remainderSeconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; seconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; display &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;minutes&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;remainderSeconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;0&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;remainderSeconds&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;title &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; display&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  timerDisplay&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; display&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the seconds, extract the whole minutes, then find the reminder seconds. In the display we check if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;remainderSeconds&lt;/code&gt; is a single digit, if so we pad it with a extra &apos;0&apos;. We then update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h1.display__time-left&lt;/code&gt; and the title of the page with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;display&lt;/code&gt;. The title of the page is displayed in the browser tab area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to display the end time (just under the count down timer display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// in timer()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;displayEndTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;then&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;displayEndTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;timestamp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; end &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;timestamp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; hour &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; end&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getHours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; adjustedHour &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; hour &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; hour &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; hour&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; minutes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; end&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getMinutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; adjustedMinutes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;minutes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;0&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;minutes&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  endTime&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`Be Back At &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;adjustedHour&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;adjustedMinutes&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;displayEndTime(endTime)&lt;/code&gt; gets the end time in ms as a parameter. We extract the hour, convert it to 12 hour format. Get the minutes, again if it is in single digits, pad it with an extra zero. Display the result in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;p.display__end-time&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to get the user input to set the timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of the buttons we get the necessary time from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-time&lt;/code&gt; attribute and make a call to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;timer()&lt;/code&gt;. This is very straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;startTimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; seconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dataset&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;time&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

buttons&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;button &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; button&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; startTimer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form component is a bit more involved. We listen to when the user &apos;submits&apos; the form, i.e. type the number and press enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;customForm&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;submit&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; mins &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;minutes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mins &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prevent the default action, get the value (represents minutes) from the text input and then call the timer. We then reset the form to empty the text field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes our count down timer project, here is the final code -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML we have -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;game&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;hole hole1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;mole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;hole hole2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;mole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    ...
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are six holes in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.game&lt;/code&gt;. Each hole holds a mole (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.mole&lt;/code&gt;) and the dirt (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.hole::after&lt;/code&gt;). By default the mole is positioned &apos;absolute&apos; with 100% displacement from the top. Given that the hole has overflow to hidden, the mole isn&apos;t seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the class &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;up&lt;/code&gt; is added to the hole, then the mole transitions up, as top displacement now becomes 0px.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.hole.up .mole&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JS given to us -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; holes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.hole&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; scoreBoard &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.score&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; moles &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.mole&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various moving parts to this game,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a random amount of time a mole should show up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a random hole for a mole to show up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the mole to come up for the random amount of time, and go down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the game starts (run on click, for 10s) do the above in a loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for clicks on a mole, update the score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt; function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0–1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range — which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll be using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Math.random&lt;/code&gt; a lot, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random&quot;&gt;MDN Docs&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random amount of time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;randomTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; max&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;max &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a random amount of time between min and max time. For our app, min and max represent milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random hole&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;randomHole()&lt;/code&gt; returns a random hole DOM element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; lastHole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;randomHole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; idx &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; hole &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;idx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;hole &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; lastHole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;duplicate hole&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;randomHole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  lastHole &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; hole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; hole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pick an index (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/code&gt;) between 0 and 5, viz the range of valid indices of holes array. If the hole is the same as the last one picked, we just call the function again. We store the most recent hole chosen in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastHole&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making the mole appear and disappear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;peep()&lt;/code&gt; makes a mole appear and disappear for a random amount of time in a random hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;peep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; time &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;randomTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; hole &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;randomHole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  hole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;up&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    hole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;up&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; time&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we pick the random time period (between 200ms and 1s) and hole, we add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;up&lt;/code&gt; class to the hole element, then register a callback to remove the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;up&lt;/code&gt; class after the given period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starting the game loop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start the game when the start button (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button onClick=&amp;quot;startGame()&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Start!&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) is clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; timeUp &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;startGame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  scoreBoard&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  timeUp &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  score &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;peep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; timeUp &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game runs for 10 seconds. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;timeUp&lt;/code&gt; keeps track whether the game is running. Score is reset to zero and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;peep()&lt;/code&gt; is called. Then a timeout is set to run at 10 seconds, which marks &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;timeUp&lt;/code&gt; as true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make a tiny modification to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;peep()&lt;/code&gt; function,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// In the setTimeout callback&lt;/span&gt;
hole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;up&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;timeUp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;peep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;peep()&lt;/code&gt; calls itself if the game is running!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;scoring mechanism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bonk()&lt;/code&gt; function tracks the hits and updates the score&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bonk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;isTrusted&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// cheater!&lt;/span&gt;
    score&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;parentNode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;up&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    scoreBoard&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; score&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  moles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mole &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mole&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; bonk&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each mole has a click event listener registered. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bonk()&lt;/code&gt; checks if the click is trusted (i.e. not scripted / automated in some way), and then updates the score and the score board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about trusted events @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted&quot;&gt;MDN Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the final code -&lt;/p&gt;

We will be creating a bunch of small examples to play with various array methods such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;some()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;every()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;findIndex()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNmRfyNg1lw&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the codepen with the starter files&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this exercise we&apos;ll be doing some more array exercises. Our sample data -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; people &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Wes&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; year&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Kait&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; year&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1986&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Irv&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; year&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1970&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Lux&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; year&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; comments &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Array.prototype.some()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].some(test_fn)&lt;/code&gt; method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt;). Each element of the array is iterated upon and the element is passed to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt;, if it returns true for any one of the elements, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].some()&lt;/code&gt; method ends and returns true. If &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt; returns false for each element, only then does &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].some()&lt;/code&gt; return false. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Array.prototype.every()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].every(test_fn)&lt;/code&gt; method tests whether all elements in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt;). Each element of the array is iterated upon and the element is passed to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt;, if it returns true for each one of the elements, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].every()&lt;/code&gt; method returns true. If &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt; returns false for even element, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].every()&lt;/code&gt; returns false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task : &lt;strong&gt;Is everyone 19 or older?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;res &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; people&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;every&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;person &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Array.prototype.find()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].find(test_fn)&lt;/code&gt; method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt;). Otherwise undefined is returned. This works like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].some()&lt;/code&gt;, except that it returns the first instance of the object rather than true or false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task : &lt;strong&gt;find the comment with the ID of 823423&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; com &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; comments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;comment &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; comment&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;823423&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Array.prototype.findIndex()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].findIndex(test_fn)&lt;/code&gt; method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt;). Otherwise -1 is returned. Works just like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].find()&lt;/code&gt;, except it returns the index, not the element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the video here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xkzDaKwinA8&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&apos;t much to talk about in this blog post as the video is a random assortment of tricks and tips, so I&apos;ll keep is short and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Debugging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;makeGreen()&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;×BREAK×DOWN×&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;makeGreen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;p&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;color &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#BADA55&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;fontSize &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;50px&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see some changes on the webpage (eg. an animation) and want to see which JS bit is causing that, then you can go to the DOM inspector and right click on the element and set a breakpoint on node attribute modification. The next time a JS function tries to change the attribute it will be paused in the debugger at that point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following are variations of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;console.logs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Regular&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;hello&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Interpolated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can format &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; as you would have formatted &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hello I am a %s string!&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;💩&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Styled&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add styles to your logged output in the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;%c I am some great text&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;font-size:50px; background:red; text-shadow: 10px 10px 0 blue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. warning!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a warning level log with a stacktrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;OH NOOO&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Error :|&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give an error level log with a stacktrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Shit!&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Info&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a info level log with no stacktrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Crocodiles eat 3-4 people per year&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;console.asset(cond, msg)&lt;/code&gt; takes in a condition expression, which if resolves to true does nothing, but if it is false assert logs an error level message with a stacktrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;p&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;ouch&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;That is wrong!&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. clearing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clears the console area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Viewing DOM Elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the dom elements, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.dir()&lt;/code&gt; also lets you inspect all the properties of the dom object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. Grouping together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create groups and log a set of logs under one group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;dogs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;dog &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;groupCollapsed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;dog&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`This is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;dog&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;dog&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;dog&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;age&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; years old`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;dog&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;dog&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;age &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; dog years old`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;groupEnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;dog&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. counting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can count how many times a particular output has been logged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Wes&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Wes&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Steve&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Steve&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Wes&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Steve&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// OUTPUT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Wes: 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Wes: 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Steve: 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Steve: 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Wes: 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Steve: 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;13. Timing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can calculate the time for a certain operation using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;console.time&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;console.timeEnd&lt;/code&gt;. As far as the strings passed to the calls are the same, it calculates the time between &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;timeEnd&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;fetching data&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;https://api.github.com/users/wesbos&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;timeEnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;fetching data&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Output&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// fetching data: 3556.47998046875ms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// {login: &quot;wesbos&quot;, id: ..., …}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;14. Table&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an array of objects with the same property, you can print them out in a tabular format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;dogs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats all for the tips and tricks, hope you found it useful!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[JS Checkbox]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the tenth project of Wes Bos's  JS30 series . To see the  whole 30 part series ,  click here

We&apos;ll be building a gmail style &quot;hold shift and check all&quot; items type list. You can check any element in the list, then hold shift and check another element, and all the elements in between should also get checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the video here &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIPYsKx1iiU&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starter code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;465&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-10-select-checkbox-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/WyzZzy/?height=265&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/WyzZzy/&apos;&gt;JS30-10-select-checkbox-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won&apos;t be touching the HTML or CSS in this project, but just have a look anyway, the structure is straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML is primarily a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.inbox&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.item&lt;/code&gt; as children. Each item has an checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;inbox&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is an inbox layout.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Check one item&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  ... &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- more items --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the checkbox strikes through the sibling paragraph. The CSS responsible for that -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;input:checked + p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #f9f9f9&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; line-through&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&apos;s get on with our JS bits! At a high level we have the following steps -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep track of the latest checked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See if shift is being clicked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If shift is clicked, run through the list of items and check everything in between&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep track of latest checked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll track the latest checked in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastChecked&lt;/code&gt;, every time there is a click on a checkbox we&apos;ll update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastChecked&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; checkboxes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.inbox input[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; lastChecked

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleCheck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    lastChecked &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

checkboxes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;checkbox &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleCheck&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Check for shift&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to check for shift because only if shift is pressed do we want to do a group check of checkboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleCheck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//check if shift key was pressed &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// and that the checkbox is checked&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;shiftKey &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;checked&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//logic goes here&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// the logic comes before updating last check as we don&apos;t want to &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//   overwrite the variable before using it&lt;/span&gt;
  lastChecked &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run through the list of items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to loop through all the items in the inbox until we hit the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastChecked&lt;/code&gt; checkbox or the checkbox currently being clicked. If we hit &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastChecked&lt;/code&gt; first, then we need to continue checking all boxes till we encounter the current box. If we come across the current box first, then we check until we hit &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastChecked&lt;/code&gt;. Either way we need to check all items in between &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastChecked&lt;/code&gt; and the current item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleCheck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;shiftKey &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;checked&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; inBetween &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
    checkboxes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cb &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cb &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; cb &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; lastChecked&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; inBetween &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;inBetween

      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;inBetween&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; cb&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;checked &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  lastChecked &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inBetween&lt;/code&gt; to keep track of whether the current element in the loop is in between &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastChecked&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The codepen with the final code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;549&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-10-select-checkbox-b&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/oyqoqp/?height=549&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/oyqoqp/&apos;&gt;JS30-10-select-checkbox-b&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; I know there are certain &quot;bugs&quot; in the code (same as Wes Bos&apos;s). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check something, uncheck it and then shift check another box, everything in between is still checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shift+check the very first time you&apos;re clicking a box, everything till the end is checked as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle these wouldn&apos;t be too hard code wise, but I let it be. It is going to be hard user flow wise. Since I don&apos;t really have an end user, there isn&apos;t much point rationalizing how this should look if it were perfect. Hence my decision to leave it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Custom video player]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the eleventh project of Wes Bos's  JS30 series .

To see the &lt;strong&gt;whole 30 part series&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;
We&apos;ll be building our own custom video player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yx-HYerClEA&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the starter files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;458&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-11-video-player-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/EREbrX/?height=398&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=css,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/EREbrX/&apos;&gt;JS30-11-video-player-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, in this project we won&apos;t be touching the HTML or CSS, but we need to understand the html structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;video&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;player__video viewer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;https://player.vimeo.com/external/194837908.sd.mp4?s=c350076905b78c67f74d7ee39fdb4fef01d12420&amp;amp;profile_id=164&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;player__controls&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;progress&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

       &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-skip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;25&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;player__button&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;25s »&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The player is contained in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.player&lt;/code&gt;, the video comes from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, the controls are under &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.player__controls&lt;/code&gt;. The animation you see when hovering on the video is a combination of CSS transition and transform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features of the player include&lt;/strong&gt; - play/pause the video, skip forward/backward, adjust speed, adjust volume, display progress and seek position in video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main steps involved in creating the player :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a reference to all the elements we need to control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a function to play/pause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the play/pause button based on state of video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the skip forward and backward functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle the volume change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle the playback speed range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display the video progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek a position in the video by clicking/dragging on the progress bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get all the elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; player &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.player&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; video &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.viewer&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; progress &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.progress&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; progressBar &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.progress__filled&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; toggle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.toggle&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; skipButtons &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;[data-skip]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; ranges &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.player__slider&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement&quot;&gt;video element&lt;/a&gt; or preferably the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement&quot;&gt;Media element&lt;/a&gt; it inherits from. We&apos;ll be using the JS properties quite a bit. If you also fancy a tutorial about the video element &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/&quot;&gt;html5rocks&lt;/a&gt; has a brilliant one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Write a function to play/pause&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;togglePlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;paused&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// You can toggle either by clicking the video or the play/pause button&lt;/span&gt;
video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; togglePlay&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; togglePlay&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function checks if the video is paused, if so it starts playing it, if not it pauses the playing video. For all the properties and function relating to the video element, please refer to the links to the docs/tutorials I&apos;ve mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update the play/pause button&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;updateButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; icon &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;paused &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;►&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;❚❚&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; icon&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;play&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; updateButton&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;pause&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; updateButton&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video can be paused / played by other means than clicking on the video / toggle button. So instead of adding the logic in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;togglePlay&lt;/code&gt; we&apos;ll listen to the &apos;play&apos; and &apos;pause&apos; events on the video element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add the skip forward and backward functionality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;skip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;currentTime &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parseFloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dataset&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;skip&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

skipButtons&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;button &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; button&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; skip&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can change the video time by assigning the new time to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.currentTime&lt;/code&gt;. The skip time is got from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-skip&lt;/code&gt; attribute. So you can go &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-10&lt;/code&gt; seconds back in time or skip &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; seconds ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Handle the volume and playback rate change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleRangeUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

ranges&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;range &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; range&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;change&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleRangeUpdate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
ranges&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;range &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; range&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousemove&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleRangeUpdate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we exploit the fact that both volume and range playback are slider elements. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.volume&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.playbackRate&lt;/code&gt; control the volume and playback speed respectively. The elements name coincides with the property of the video object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;range&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;volume&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;player__slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;0.05&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;range&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;playbackRate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;player__slider&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;0.5&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;0.1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence we can just use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video[this.name]&lt;/code&gt;, it will resolve to either &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.volume&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.playbackRate&lt;/code&gt; based on which element we&apos;re sliding. Assigning to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.value&lt;/code&gt; remains same anyway. This way we don&apos;t have to duplicate the code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Display the video progress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleProgress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; percent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;currentTime &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;duration&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  progressBar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;flexBasis &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;percent&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;%`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;timeupdate&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleProgress&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yellow bar shows the % of the video that has completed. We attach a &apos;timeupdate&apos; event listener to the video element, every time it fires the percent is calculated and the progressBar&apos;s CSS &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;flexBasis&lt;/code&gt; property is set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seek a position in the video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;scrub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; scrubTime &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetX &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; progress&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetWidth&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;duration&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;currentTime &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; scrubTime&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

progress&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; scrub&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get from the click event the relative position where the mouse was clicked, then calculate the % width and get the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scrubTime&lt;/code&gt; from that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to enable dragging as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; mousedown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
progress&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousemove&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mousedown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;scrub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
progress&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousedown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mousedown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
progress&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseup&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mousedown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the mouse is down and we move the mouse over the progress bar, scrub is triggered and the target position is seeked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all for making your own minimalistic custom video player! Here is the final code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;473&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-11-video-player-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/gKeKLg/?height=373&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/gKeKLg/&apos;&gt;JS30-11-video-player-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.

To see the &lt;strong&gt;whole 30 part series&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;
We&apos;ll be building a key sequence detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_A5eVOIqGLU&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is pretty much no starter file, this project is a simple JS function. The idea is to trigger an action when a particular key sequence is pressed. The initial idea comes form the &quot;Konami code&quot; (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A) which enabled various cheats in retro games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store the code, get the length of the code (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an array that records the last &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; keys pressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the characters in the array matches the secret code, trigger the action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//this is the array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; pressed &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//the secret code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; secretCode &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;yolo&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// e.key is the key is the key pressed, add it to the array&lt;/span&gt;
  pressed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// cut the array to the size of secretCode.length from the end of the array&lt;/span&gt;
  pressed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;secretCode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; pressed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; secretCode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//convert array into string, see if it is the secretCode&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pressed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;secretCode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//take action&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cornify_add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&apos;s pretty much it! Hopefully the comments in the code makes it obvious. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornify.com/&quot;&gt;cornify.js&lt;/a&gt; is a library that adds unicorns and rainbows to your webpage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the end result! Try typing &apos;yolo&apos; and see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;

To see the &lt;strong&gt;whole 30 part series&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;
We&apos;ll be building an image slide in animation which is triggered by scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzRsENVD3W8&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the starter files -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;465&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-13-slide-scroll-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/aKYjPw/?height=265&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/aKYjPw/&apos;&gt;JS30-13-slide-scroll-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general algorithm is as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture the scroll event data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the position wrt the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect the image&apos;s height and check if more than half of it should be on screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If so make it visible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now one thing to note is that the scroll event will fire hundreds of times on a scroll, so we need a debounce function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;debounce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;func&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; wait &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; immediate &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; timeout&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; context &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;later&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      timeout &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;immediate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; func&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; callNow &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; immediate &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;timeout&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;clearTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;timeout&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    timeout &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;later&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; wait&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;callNow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; func&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;debounce()&lt;/code&gt; is a closure that ensures that even though it is called as many times as possible, the call to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;func()&lt;/code&gt; will go through only once every wait milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the code we have to write,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capture scroll data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; sliderImages &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.slide-in&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;checkSlide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;scroll&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;debounce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;checkSlide&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the images we want to animate have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.slide-in&lt;/code&gt; property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.slide-in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;all .5s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.align-left.slide-in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;translateX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;-30%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0.95&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.align-right.slide-in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;translateX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;30%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0.95&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property ensures that the image is completely transparent and has a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0.5s&lt;/code&gt; transition. Based on whether the image is to the left or right it has a slight offset (left is moved further left, right further right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calculate the positions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image should disappear once the half point of the image scrolls into view, or when the image scrolls out of view from the top. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.scrollY&lt;/code&gt; gives us the number of px scrolled beyond the top. If you haven&apos;t scrolled at all, it&apos;ll be zero. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.innerHeight&lt;/code&gt; gives us the height of the viewport. So &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scrollY + innerHeight&lt;/code&gt; gives us the number of px that has come into the viewport (or scrolled past it). &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sliderImage.height&lt;/code&gt; is the height of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sliderImage.offsetTop&lt;/code&gt; is the distance of the top of the image from top of the page in px. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;checkSlide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  sliderImages&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sliderImage &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// half way through the image&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; isHalfShown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;scrollY &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHeight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
                         &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sliderImage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetTop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;sliderImage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// bottom of the image&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; imageBottom &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sliderImage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetTop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; sliderImage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; isNotScrolledPast &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;scrollY &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; imageBottom&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// if more that half is over the scroll view *and* it hasn&apos;t scrolled out of view&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;isHalfShown &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; isNotScrolledPast&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        sliderImage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        sliderImage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to see if half is shown, we get the total length that has been scrolled into view (from top) = &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.scrollY + window.innerHeight&lt;/code&gt; and then see if thats greater than the top of the image + half it&apos;s height, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sliderImage.offsetTop +sliderImage.height / 2&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also we have to check that the image hasn&apos;t scrolled pass the top so we see if the top position is lesser that the image&apos;s bottom position, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.scrollY &amp;lt; imageBottom&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If both these conditions are met, then the CSS class &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; is added to the image, which animates it into view. If either of them aren&apos;t met, the class is removed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the final code :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;465&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-13-slide-scroll-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/LrmYve/?height=265&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/LrmYve/&apos;&gt;JS30-13-slide-scroll-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.

To see the &lt;strong&gt;whole 30 part series&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;
Well, this isn&apos;t really a project, just a series of experiments to understand the difference between copying by value and by reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YnfwDQ5XYF4&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&apos;t be adding a codepen as you can simply copy paste the commands into your dev-tools console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets start with strings and numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;start &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; strings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; numbers and booleans
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; age &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; age2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; age&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;age&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; age2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//100, 100&lt;/span&gt;
age &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;age&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; age2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//200, 100&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Wes&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; name2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; name2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//wes, wes&lt;/span&gt;
name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;wesley&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; name2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//wesley, wes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;strings and numbers are immutable, we can reassign variables to newer strings/numbers, but we can&apos;t manipulate values itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say we have an array&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; players &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Wes&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Sarah&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Ryan&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Poppy&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we make a copy of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; team &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; players&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;players&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; team&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think we can just do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;team&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Lux&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;however what happens when we update that array?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;players&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; team&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//[&quot;Wes&quot;, &quot;Sarah&quot;, &quot;Ryan&quot;, &quot;Lux&quot;] [&quot;Wes&quot;, &quot;Sarah&quot;, &quot;Ryan&quot;, &quot;Lux&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no - we have edited the original array too! Why? It&apos;s because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// slice copies all the elements to the new array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; team2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; players&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// concat also creates a new array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; team3 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;players&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// or use the new ES6 Spread&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; team4 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;players&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// array from is another verstile way of copying, &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//  you can add extra stuff like a map func or a &apos;this&apos; to be used&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; team5 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;players&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try updating any of these and see that the players array remains unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects are similar to arrays, let&apos;s say we have a person object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; person &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Wes Bos&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    age&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make a copy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; captain &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; person&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
captain&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;number &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;person&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//{name: &quot;Wes Bos&quot;, age: 80, number: 99}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we take a copy instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; cap2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; person&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; number&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; age&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cap2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Object.assign()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method to create a clone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. You can use a library like lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it (performance reasons, plus you probably wouldn&apos;t need it)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; wes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Wes&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    age&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    social&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      twitter&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;@wesbos&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      facebook&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;wesbos.developer&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; dev &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; wes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
dev&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;social&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;twitter &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;@yolo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;wes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Object has changed, twitter handle is now @yolo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// {name:&quot;Wes&quot;, age:100, social:{twitter: &quot;@yolo&quot;, facebook: &quot;wesbos.developer&quot;}}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; dev2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;wes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
dev2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;social&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;twitter &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;@yolo2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;wes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Output hasn&apos;t changed, twitter handle is not @yolo2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// {name:&quot;Wes&quot;, age:100, social:{twitter: &quot;@yolo&quot;, facebook: &quot;wesbos.developer&quot;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have a deep copy using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;JSON.stringify&lt;/code&gt;.

To see the &lt;strong&gt;whole 30 part series&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;
We&apos;ll be creating an effect where the text shadow of an element is controlled by the mouse position!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video can be found here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zaz9gLI-Xac&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The codepen for the starter code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;457&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-16-TextShadow-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/XYYpdL/?height=407&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=css,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/XYYpdL/&apos;&gt;JS30-16-TextShadow-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starter files are minimal, the HTML element who&apos;s text shadow well be manipulating is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; element below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;hero&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;contenteditable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;🔥WOAH!&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;contenteditable&lt;/code&gt; attribute set on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which means the user can edit the text contents of that element!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;text-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 10px 10px 0 &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 50px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the CSS we just set a simple text shadow to the title. (Iv&apos;e changed the color values a little bit to make it appear shadow like!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the text shadow to follow the cursor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mousemove&lt;/code&gt; event listener&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract the coordinates wrt to the window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map the coordinates to the displacement of the text shadow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the text shadow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding the event listener&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; hero &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.hero&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; text &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; hero&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;h1&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// tracking the mouse will only be done in the div.hero area&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// (in this case it is the whole page though)&lt;/span&gt;
hero&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousemove&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; shadow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extract the coordinates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event object&apos;s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pageX, pageY&lt;/code&gt; properties give us the X, Y coordinates of the mouse wrt the page. But we need it with respect to the hero element, so we use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;offsetX, offsetY&lt;/code&gt; properties. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/offsetX&quot;&gt;offsetX property&lt;/a&gt; of the MouseEvent provides the offset in the X coordinate of the mouse pointer between that event and the padding edge of the target node. So incase we&apos;re hovering over &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.hero&lt;/code&gt; we have to adjust the x, y values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; offsetX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; offsetY&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//adjusting the values if e.target is not div.hero&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// by adding relative position of e.target&lt;/span&gt;
    x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetLeft&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetTop&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Map the coordinates to the displacement of the text shadow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us assume the range of the displacement of the text shadow to be max of 50px from the actual text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; range &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//50 px * 2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; offsetX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; offsetY&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetLeft&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetTop&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// height and width of div.hero&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; offsetWidth&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; offsetHeight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; height &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; hero&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; xRange &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; range&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; range&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; yRange &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; range&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; range&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we&apos;re doing here is simply mapping the range of width to current &apos;x&apos; and &apos;y&apos; to calculate the displacement. For ex, when &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x=0&lt;/code&gt; the x displacement is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-50px&lt;/code&gt; and if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x == width&lt;/code&gt;, the x displacement is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;50px&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, get the fraction, multiply to get the value, shift the origin. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x/width&lt;/code&gt; give us the fraction, multiplying by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; gives us the value, but we need to subtract &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;range/2&lt;/code&gt; since the displacement is from the center of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; (origin is here, not top of screen) and going to the left would mean a negative value for x. Same applies for y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update the text shadow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textShadow &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;xRange&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;yRange&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;px 0 rgba(255,0,255,0.7)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update the text shadow with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;xRange, yRange&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data we have at hand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; bands &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;The Plot in You&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;The Devil Wears Prada&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Pierce the Veil&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Norma Jean&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;The Bled&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Say Anything&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;The Midway State&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;We Came as Romans&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Counterparts&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Oh, Sleeper&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;A Skylit Drive&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Anywhere But Here&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;An Old Dog&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to insert the sorted data as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;bands&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sorting the data we need to ignore articles such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;the, an, a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps to take&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call standard sort on the array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function to strip the strings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the stripped version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the elements to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ul#bands&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Call standard sort on the array&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we sort normally, with the articles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; sortedBands &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; bands&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; b &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//[&quot;A Skylit Drive&quot;, &quot;An Old Dog&quot;, &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot;, &quot;Counterparts&quot;, &quot;Norma Jean&quot;, &quot;Oh, Sleeper&quot;, &quot;Pierce the Veil&quot;, &quot;Say Anything&quot;, &quot;The Bled&quot;, &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, &quot;The Midway State&quot;, &quot;The Plot in You&quot;, &quot;We Came as Romans&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Function to strip the strings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll use a RegEx to find any instance of articles (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/i&lt;/code&gt; implies case insensitivity), and reduce them to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;bandName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; bandName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex&quot;&gt;/^(a |the |an )/i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Compare the stripped version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; sortedBands &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; bands&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add the elements to the list&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map the list data to a list of strings of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s. Then concatenate them and set them to the inner html of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#bands&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHTML &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Today we&apos;ll be using map and reduce to add time of individual videos find the total time of a playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SadWPo2KZWg&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codepen -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML structure we have is something similar to what there would be in a youtube playlist -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;videos&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;5:43&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Video 1
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;2:33&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Video 2
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  ...
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents the playlist, each &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a video item. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-time&lt;/code&gt; attribute holds the time of the video. What we need to do is find the total time of the playlist, i.e. add the individual times (represented as a string) of each element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract all the times from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert each string in the array to seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add all the seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display the total time in &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extract times from items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Array.from&lt;/code&gt; to create an array object from the NodeList object &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;document.querySelectorAll&lt;/code&gt; gives us.
Then we map the array to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-time&lt;/code&gt; value of each element to get an array of times in strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; items &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.videos li&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; times &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;item &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dataset&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;time&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Convert string array into seconds array&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use map to convert each string into an integer which represents the time of the video in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; seconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; times&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;time &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sec&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; time&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;:&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;parseFloat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;min&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; sec
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;4:30&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;, it is split into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[&amp;quot;4&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;30&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; and we convert it into numbers with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;parseFloat()&lt;/code&gt;. We capture the minutes and seconds in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;min, sec&lt;/code&gt; by ES6 destructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add all the seconds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use reduce to add all the time in seconds to get the total time in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; totalSec &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; seconds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sum&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; time&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sum &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; time&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Display the total time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to split the time in sec to hours, minutes and seconds. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;totalSec&lt;/code&gt; is the time we have in seconds, assume it&apos;s equal to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;125&lt;/code&gt;. First let&apos;s shave off the whole minutes from the seconds - &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;totalSec % 60&lt;/code&gt; gives us the reminder of seconds once we have divided by 60 (we use 60 since one min has 60 sec). &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;125 % 60&lt;/code&gt; will give us 5. Now &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;totalMin&lt;/code&gt; is the number of whole minutes we have, that is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(125-5) / 60&lt;/code&gt; viz 2 minutes. We repeat a similar process for hours - shave off any extra minutes and divide by 60 to get the whole hours. Try it out with a bigger number (greater than 3600, since there are 3600 secs in an hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; secs &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; totalSec &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; totalMin &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;totalSec &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; secs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; mins &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; totalMin &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; hours &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;totalMin &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; mins&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;

console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;hours &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;:&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; mins &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;:&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; secs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes our exercise. Final codepen -&lt;/p&gt;

Today we learn how to use the built in Speech Recognition in the browser. Text to speech in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mJC0A72Fnw&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starter files -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;465&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-20-speech-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/vrzKBY/?height=265&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/vrzKBY/&apos;&gt;JS30-20-speech-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have to do is understand the speech in real time using the speech recognition API, and once the user has finished speaking a sentence (rather pauses the speech), append a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.words&lt;/code&gt; and start listening for the next time the user speaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JS we have &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;SpeechRecognition &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;SpeechRecognition &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;webkitSpeechRecognition&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SpeechRecognition interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the recognition service; this also handles the SpeechRecognitionEvent sent from the recognition service. This is still an experimental technology. In chrome you need &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.webkitSpeechRecognition&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the speech recognition object, set the language. Controls whether interim results should be returned (true) or not (false.) Interim results are results that are not yet final. Setting it to true gives the whole app a realtime feel (i.e. text appears as you speak)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; recognition &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
recognition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;interimResults &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
recognition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lang &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;en-US&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Append a paragraph to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.words&lt;/code&gt;, this is where the converted text goes initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;p&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; words &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.words&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
words&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we add the event handler to get notified of results. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;onresult&lt;/code&gt; property of the SpeechRecognition interface represents an event handler that will run when the speech recognition service returns a result — a word or phrase has been positively recognized and this has been communicated back to the app (when the result event fires). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we&apos;ve set &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;recognition.interimResults = true&lt;/code&gt;, we&apos;ll get a bunch if intermediate values as well (we&apos;ll be updating the screen on intermediate values as well to give a realtime feel). The result of the last event generated will have an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isFinal&lt;/code&gt; property which will determine the final result we see on screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;recognition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;result&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; e &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionEvent&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.results&lt;/code&gt; property is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResultList&lt;/code&gt; object. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResultList&lt;/code&gt; contains &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResult&lt;/code&gt; objects. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.results&lt;/code&gt; can be accessed like an array. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;r.results[0]&lt;/code&gt; returns the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResult&lt;/code&gt; at position 0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResult&lt;/code&gt; object contains a list of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionAlternative&lt;/code&gt; objects that contain individual results. Each &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResult&lt;/code&gt; can also be accessed like arrays. So &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.result[0][0]&lt;/code&gt; returns the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionAlternative&lt;/code&gt; at position 0 of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResult&lt;/code&gt; at position 0 of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResultList&lt;/code&gt; (viz &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.results&lt;/code&gt;). We then return the transcript property of the SpeechRecognitionAlternative object. What we want is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.result[0][0].transcript&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&apos;s a bit confusing, but this is how it is! You can learn more about speech recognition @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition&quot;&gt;MDN Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now filling in the event listener correctly -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;recognition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;result&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; e &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; transcript &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;results&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;transcript

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;results&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;isFinal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      p &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;p&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      words&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the first &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpeechRecognitionResult&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isFinal&lt;/code&gt; property set to true, then we understand that it the user has stopped speaking and the API is done translating. We create a new &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element and add it to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.words&lt;/code&gt;. Anything spoken after now goes into the new paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we start the speech recognition on page load&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;recognition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
recognition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;end&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; recognition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;start&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;recognition.start()&lt;/code&gt; Starts the speech recognition service listening to incoming audio with intent to recognize grammars associated with the current SpeechRecognition. Once the user pauses and the API finishes converting speech to text, a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; event is triggered on the recognition object. We pass &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;recognition.start&lt;/code&gt; to ask the browser to start listening again (otherwise the browser stops listening, and speech to text happens only once).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all for this small experiment. Final code -&lt;/p&gt;

We will be creating a drawing canvas as seen below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZGAzJ0drl0&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the minimal starter code below -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;465&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-08-html-canvas-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/GGQObb/?height=265&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/GGQObb/&apos;&gt;JS30-08-html-canvas-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we&apos;ve got nothing more than a simple canvas element! That is because all the magic happens in the JS bits we&apos;re going to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;canvas/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element and the API on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API&quot;&gt;MDN Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a fully blow out &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage&quot;&gt;tutorial series&lt;/a&gt; for those who wish to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&apos;s get started. There are multiple things we need to do in order to obtain our end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialization - get a handle to the canvas, set basic settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track the user input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw lines on the canvas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the color of the line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the thickness of the line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initialization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handle to manipulate the canvas is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx&lt;/code&gt;, the 2D context of the canvas. You have a 3D context for drawing 3D objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; canvas &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#draw&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; ctx &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;2d&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canvas width and height are set to that of the whole window&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerWidth
canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHeight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the canvas element like a piece of canvas (duh!) which you can draw and paint on. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.strokeStyle&lt;/code&gt; sets the color to use, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.lineWidth&lt;/code&gt; sets the width of the line. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.lineJoin&lt;/code&gt; property determines how two connecting segments (of lines, arcs or curves) in a shape are joined together, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.lineCap&lt;/code&gt; property determines how the end points of every line are drawn (three possible values for this property and those are: butt, round and square).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/strokeStyle&quot;&gt;strokeStyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineJoin&quot;&gt;lineJoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineCap&quot;&gt;lineCap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineWidth&quot;&gt;lineWidth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;strokeStyle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;blue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lineJoin &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;round&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lineCap &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;round&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lineWidth &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Track user interactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to know when the user has actually clicked on the canvas and is dragging the cursor. For this purpose we&apos;ll have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isDrawing&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; isDrawing &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;isDrawing&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//rest of the logic in here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousemove&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; draw&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousedown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; isDrawing &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseup&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; isDrawing &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mouseout&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; isDrawing &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&apos;ve done a bunch of things here! The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; function is what actually does the drawing on a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mousemove&lt;/code&gt; event on the canvas, but only if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isDrawing&lt;/code&gt; is true. Now &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isDrawing&lt;/code&gt; is set to true when there is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mousedown&lt;/code&gt; event on the canvas (i.e. we click on the canvas). When we unclick the mouse (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mouseup&lt;/code&gt;) or when we leave the canvas area (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mouseout&lt;/code&gt;), then &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isDrawing&lt;/code&gt; is set to false again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drawing lines on the canvas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how drawing a line on the canvas works, let&apos;s say you want to draw a line from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(10,10)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(50,50)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;moveTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;lineTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start drawing by moving to the point of the desired location (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.moveTo(10, 10)&lt;/code&gt;) and then draw the line to the desired destination (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.lineTo(50, 50)&lt;/code&gt;). But until this point nothing is really drawn on the canvas. The drawing happens only after you call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.stroke()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when the user moves over the canvas with the mouse, a stream of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mousemove&lt;/code&gt; events are triggered and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw(e)&lt;/code&gt; is called (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; having the event data). &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(e.offsetX, e.offsetY)&lt;/code&gt; have the (x,y) coordinates of the mouse wrt to canvas. These events matter only if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isDrawing&lt;/code&gt; is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to draw lines we need a start position (where the user has clicked), and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lineTo()&lt;/code&gt; the new position and an immediate &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;stroke()&lt;/code&gt;. So as we&apos;re dragging our mouse while clicking we leave a trail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following code moves the drawing position to where the user has clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//modifying the mousedown event listener&lt;/span&gt;
canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;mousedown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  isDrawing &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;moveTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetY&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; function has now been modified to draw the line.
The call to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.lineTo()&lt;/code&gt; also updates the drawing position to where the line was drawn (i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(e.offsetX, e.offsetY)&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;isDrawing&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;lineTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;offsetY&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we have a simple drawing canvas! You can see the results below -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;413&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-08-html-canvas-b&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/aKqQGL/?height=413&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/aKqQGL/&apos;&gt;JS30-08-html-canvas-b&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the finishing touches! We need to change both the width of the strokes and the color as the user drags on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change the color of the line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be done by changing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;strokeStyle&lt;/code&gt; incrementally inside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; function. We&apos;ll be setting the color in HSL format, that way we can change the color across the RGB spectrum just by adjusting the hue factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; hue &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lineWidth &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lineWidth &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    widthDelta &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;widthDelta
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final code is here -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;455&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-08-html-canvas-c&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/vrdvdY/?height=415&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/vrdvdY/&apos;&gt;JS30-08-html-canvas-c&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the final code is slightly different from WesBos&apos;s code! The difference in the output line being slightly &quot;dotted&quot; (not a smooth one). This is because Wes used a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lastY&lt;/code&gt; variable to store the latest position, I relied on the fact that drawing position would update automatically to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(x,y)&lt;/code&gt; after a call to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lineTo(x,y)&lt;/code&gt; was made. The line was smooth before I added &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.beginPath()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; (see the above codepen). But then the color and the width of the lines already drawn would also change, hence I needed to add &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.beginPath()&lt;/code&gt;. This in turn makes my line dotted whenever the cursor is dragged quickly! (Try removing line 19  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.beginPath()&lt;/code&gt; in the codepen and see what happens!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I found this observation interesting so I let it be! Here is the final one which works like Wes&apos; does!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;submit&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;+ Add Item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text box to add items is essentially a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;form.add-items&lt;/code&gt; element. The list of items already added will be displayed in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ul.plates&lt;/code&gt; element.
There was another other SVG logo as a part of the HTML I didn&apos;t include as it just made it harder to read (with no significance to the functionality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the CSS, all the styling is quite standard, except one I found interesting. If you&apos;d watch the video you&apos;d see that the checkbox gives you a taco when you check it. Clearly not the standard defaults! So what&apos;s happening here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s look at what an item looks like when it&apos;s added to the list, you&apos;ll see that the checkbox has a label next to it with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;for=&amp;quot;item0&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; property. This links the label to the element with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;id=&amp;quot;item0&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, which is the adjacent checkbox. So clicking on the label has the same effect as clicking on the adjacent checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;item0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;item0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hi&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in the CSS, all input elements under &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.plates&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;display: none&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. the checkbox won&apos;t be seen. Instead the empty white box and the taco come from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;label:before&lt;/code&gt;, where the label is the one adjacent to the invisible checkbox. When the checkbox is checked (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input:checked&lt;/code&gt;), it turns the content of the before pseudo element to a taco. So what we see as getting checked/unchecked is not even the checkbox, but rather a pseudo element of the label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.plates input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; none&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.plates input + label:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;⬜️&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 10px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.plates input:checked + label:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;🌮&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; items &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have handles to the form where the user inputs new items and the list where the items are displayed. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; array holds all the items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main steps involved to complete our app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add new items to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display the items in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle an item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the list to local storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding new items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We add new items using a html form. Submitting a form by default makes a get request and goes to the new URL. We call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;e.preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; to prevent the default behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; text &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;[name=item]&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      done&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//  display the list - populateList();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//  store to local storage - localStorage.set()&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

addItems&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;submit&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; addItem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;addItem()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; refers to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;form.add-items&lt;/code&gt; DOM object. We then select the text input element and get the text inside of it. We create a new items object and then push it into the items list. Once it is added we call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reset()&lt;/code&gt; on the form to clear the input text box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Display the items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;populateList()&lt;/code&gt; does the work of taking in an array and displaying the list. We could have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;populateList()&lt;/code&gt; just use the global &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;itemsList&lt;/code&gt; variables, but that would be hardcoding, it&apos;s better to pass the variables in case we ever want to use the functions for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;plates &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; platesList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  platesList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHTML &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; plates&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;plate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`
      &amp;lt;li&gt;
        &amp;lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; data-index=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; id=&quot;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;plate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;done &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;checked&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; /&gt;
        &amp;lt;label for=&quot;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;plate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&gt;
      &amp;lt;/li&gt;
    `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//  display the list - populateList()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; itemsList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;populateList()&lt;/code&gt; uses template strings and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].map&lt;/code&gt; to create &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements from each element in the array, which is late concatenated into one string which &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;platesList.innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; is set to. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;addItem&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/code&gt; to render all the current items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toggle an item&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;toggleDone&lt;/code&gt; deals with the click event to toggle an item. We can attach a listener on the checkbox element, but the moment we add a new item, all &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements are recreated by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/code&gt;. Hence adding an event listener on those items makes no sense. We solve this issue by using event delegation - we let the parent element take care of the click event to toggle an item. The parent in this case is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ul.item-plates&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggleDone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// skip this unless it&apos;s an input&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; el &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; index &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; el&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dataset&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;done &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;done&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; itemsList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

itemsList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; toggleDone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had paid close attention to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/code&gt; function you&apos;d see that the input element for the item has &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-index=${i}&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is the index of that item in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; array. So now &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;toggleDone&lt;/code&gt; checks if the event target is a input element (only input element being a checkbox), extracts the index from the data attribute, toggles the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;done&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; array, and then re-renders the list by calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code up until this point &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;437&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-15-LocalStorage-b&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/vrrXZz/?height=437&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/vrrXZz/&apos;&gt;JS30-15-LocalStorage-b&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Save the list to LocalStorage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to persist the list after a refresh or for a later point in time, for this we&apos;ll use local storage. Local storage is a key value store where the key and value are strings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// set the value &quot;Tom&quot; for key &quot;myCat&quot; in the local storage&lt;/span&gt;
localStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;myCat&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Tom&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// cat has value &quot;Tom&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; cat &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; localStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;myCat&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//remove the &quot;myCat&quot; key from local storage&lt;/span&gt;
localStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;removeItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;myCat&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about Local Storage @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage&quot;&gt;MDN Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we want to keep the local storage in sync with the UI, we&apos;ll update the local storage when ever we call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;populateList()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggleDone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
  localStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;items&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; itemsList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
  localStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;items&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;populateList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; itemsList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also we need to get the items from local storage when we load the page. We&apos;ll modify &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; array to take read from the local storage first, if it doesn&apos;t have an &apos;items&apos; key, we&apos;ll assign it to an empty array as we had earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; items &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;localStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;items&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That completes our to-do list kind of app. The final codepen (note that local storage bits may not work in the codepen iframe)&lt;/p&gt;

Today we&apos;ll use getUserMedia and Canvas to capture a video stream from a user&apos;s webcam and manipulate the pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElWFcBlVk-o&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;465&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-19-webcam-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/ZRjOgz/?height=265&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/ZRjOgz/&apos;&gt;JS30-19-webcam-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re going to be working on a bunch of experiments relating to webcam data and HTML canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting webcam data and displaying it via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paint the data to a canvas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a photo at any given time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add effects to the video in realtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JS template we&apos;re given -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the video and canvas elements, the canvas&apos; 2D context, strip is the div where the photos are displayed, snap is the audio element that triggers on photo capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; video &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.player&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; canvas &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.photo&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; ctx &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;2d&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; strip &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.strip&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; snap &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.snap&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get and display webcam data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;MediaDevices.getUserMedia()&lt;/code&gt; method prompts the user for permission to use a media input which produces a MediaStream with tracks containing the requested types of media. That stream can include, for example, a video track, an audio track, and possibly other track types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It returns a Promise that resolves to a MediaStream object. If the user denies permission, or matching media is not available, then the promise is rejected with PermissionDeniedError or NotFoundError respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getVideo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  navigator&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;mediaDevices&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getUserMedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; audio&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;localMediaStream &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createObjectURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;localMediaStream&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;err &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`OH NO!!!`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; err&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;URL.createObjectURL(param)&lt;/code&gt; method creates a DOMString containing a URL representing the object given in the parameter (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;param&lt;/code&gt;). The URL lifetime is tied to the document in the window on which it was created. The new object URL represents the specified File object or Blob object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;param&lt;/code&gt; : A File, Blob or MediaSource object to create an object URL for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The url created looks like this &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;blob:http://localhost:3000/11ca48db-0726-4e9a-a0af-7131c2a93748&lt;/code&gt;. We assign this as the video element&apos;s source, and set it to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt;. This will show in realtime what the webcam sees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paint the data on a canvas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;drawImage()&lt;/code&gt; method of the Canvas 2D API provides different ways to draw an image onto the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;void ctx.drawImage(image, dx, dy, dWidth, dHeight)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; : An element to draw into the context. The specification permits any canvas image source (CanvasImageSource), specifically, a CSSImageValue, an HTMLImageElement, an SVGImageElement, an HTMLVideoElement, an HTMLCanvasElement, an ImageBitmap, or an OffscreenCanvas.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dx&lt;/code&gt; : The X coordinate in the destination canvas at which to place the top-left corner of the source image.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dy&lt;/code&gt; : The Y coordinate in the destination canvas at which to place the top-left corner of the source image.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dWidth&lt;/code&gt; : The width to draw the image in the destination canvas. This allows scaling of the drawn image. If not specified, the image is not scaled in width when drawn.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dHeight&lt;/code&gt; : The height to draw the image in the destination canvas. This allows scaling of the drawn image. If not specified, the image is not scaled in height when drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paintToCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;videoWidth&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;videoHeight&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;drawImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the width and height of the video source (in my case 640 x 480), set it as the canvas dimensions. The image is redrawn every 16 milliseconds, or little over 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take a photo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the &quot;take photo&quot; button triggers the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;takePhoto&lt;/code&gt; function. The function plays the &apos;snap&apos; audio, captures the canvas data into a jpeg.
Then a link tag is created with the attribute &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;download&lt;/code&gt;. The image captured is placed inside the link as a img tag. When the user clicks on the image thumbnail, the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;takePhoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// played the sound&lt;/span&gt;
  snap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;currentTime &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  snap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// take the data out of the canvas&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; canvas&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toDataURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;image/jpeg&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  link&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;href &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  link&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;download&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;handsome&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  link&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHTML &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&amp;lt;img src=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; alt=&quot;Handsome Man&quot; /&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  strip&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;insertBefore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;link&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; strip&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;firsChild&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;canvas.toDataURL(&amp;#39;image/jpeg&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt; call converts the image the canvas is displaying into a JPEG and then turns it into a data url format &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AA...QSkZ2Q==&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs&quot;&gt;Data URLs&lt;/a&gt; are URLs prefixed with the data: scheme, allow content creators to embed small files inline in documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cool effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the effects we&apos;ll have the following steps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw image to canvas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract pixels from canvas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transform the pixel data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the pixels back to the canvas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this we&apos;ll need to know how to extract and write the pixels to the canvas and how the pixel data actually looks like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the pixel data out, we have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.getImageData(sx, sy, sw, sh)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;getImageData()&lt;/code&gt; method of the Canvas 2D API returns an ImageData object representing the underlying pixel data for the area of the canvas denoted by the rectangle which starts at (sx, sy) and has an sw width and sh height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.putImageData(imgData, x, y)&lt;/code&gt; puts back the image data (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;imgData&lt;/code&gt;) starting from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x,y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual data is of type &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData&quot;&gt;ImageData&lt;/a&gt;. The ImageData interface represents the underlying pixel data of an area of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. The data is contained in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ImageData.data&lt;/code&gt; which is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Uint8ClampedArray&lt;/code&gt; representing a one-dimensional array containing the data in the RGBA order, with integer values between 0 and 255 (included). The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Uint8ClampedArray&lt;/code&gt; array represents an array of 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the whole image is represented as an array, each set of 4 array elements represent a pixel, i.e. an array of 8 elements would map to
[r1,g1,b1,a1, r2,g2,b2,a2] representing the RGBA value of two pixels. Since we our video is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;640x480&lt;/code&gt; we&apos;ll have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1228800&lt;/code&gt; pixels (640 * 480 * 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calls to the transforming functions will be added to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;paintToCanvas&lt;/code&gt; shown below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paintToCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//draw img to canvas&lt;/span&gt;
    ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;drawImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;video&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// take the pixels out&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; pixels &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getImageData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; height&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// mess with them&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// pixels = redEffect(pixels); // - red effect&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// pixels = rgbSplit(pixels); // - rgb split&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ctx.globalAlpha = 0.8;  // - ghosting &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// pixels = greenScreen(pixels); // green screen&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// put them back&lt;/span&gt;
    ctx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;putImageData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to write each of the transforming function -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Red effect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop through each pixel (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i+=4&lt;/code&gt;). Increment the red value, decrement the green and half the blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;redEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// RED&lt;/span&gt;
    pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// GREEN&lt;/span&gt;
    pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Blue&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us an overall reddish aura/filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RGB split&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We displace the red, green and blue values of each pixel by different amounts to create the same image split in three but with red, blue and green tinges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rgbSplit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// GREEN&lt;/span&gt;
    pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;175&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Blue&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ghosting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the ghosting effect using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.globalAlpha&lt;/code&gt; property of the Canvas 2D API which specifies the alpha value that is applied to shapes and images before they are drawn onto the canvas. The value is in the range from 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.globalAlpha = 0.1&lt;/code&gt; and then call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.putImageData(pixels, 0, 0)&lt;/code&gt;. This persists the old image on the screen as the new image has a transparency of only 10%. So a image that is written persists for 10 more frames (since opacity of each incoming frame is only 10%), which makes it seem as though the hand is following you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Green Screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the different thresholds for RGB values from the input sliders, then we extract RGB values for each pixel. Make sure that each of the RGB values fall within their respective min and max values. If not set opacity to zero - wiping out the pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;greenScreen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pixels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; levels &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.rgb input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That concludes this lengthy tutorial.

To see the &lt;strong&gt;whole 30 part series&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;
We will be building a &quot;clock&quot; as using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;s, some CSS animation and javascript. The idea is to replicate a minimalistic analog wall clock with an hours, minutes and seconds hand. Here is the video below -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xu87YWbr4X0&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the codepen for the starter file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;520&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-02-clock-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/wXqaJv/?height=520&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=css,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/wXqaJv/&apos;&gt;JS30-02-clock-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML is simple and minimalistic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;clock&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;clock-face&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;hand hour-hand&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;hand min-hand&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;hand second-hand&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.clock&lt;/code&gt; is the circular outer body of the clock, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.clock-face&lt;/code&gt; is the container for the hands. The three children divs represent the hour, minute and seconds hand respectively (as is evident by the class names).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSS is slightly more interesting (and involved). The clock outline is just a div with the border radius and border width set. Some box shadow for the styling. I learnt that you can apply multiple box shadows to a single element, something I did not know before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General box shadow format : &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;box-shadow: offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius | color&lt;/code&gt;. You can have multiple box shadows by comma separating the values as seen below. You can learn more about the box-shadow property @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow&quot;&gt;MDN Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;20px solid white&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;50%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    0 0 0 4px &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0,0,0,0.1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;,
    inset 0 0 0 3px #EFEFEF,
    inset 0 0 10px black,
    0 0 10px &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0,0,0,0.2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.clock-face&lt;/code&gt; is the container which holds the three hands. The height of each hand is 6px, so to account for it the container is moved up by 3px.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.clock-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;-3px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.hand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* 50% width of div.clock-face */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;50%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;6px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* places it in between (the clock-face&apos;s translateY(-3px) takes care of the offset) */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; absolute&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;50%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform-origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 100%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;90deg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; all 0.05s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transition-timing-function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cubic-bezier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform-origin&lt;/code&gt; gives the point at which the rotation transform is to take place - default would be at the center of the hand, but we want it to rotate around the right endpoint. Setting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform-origin: 100%&lt;/code&gt; does this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hands by default are at &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0deg&lt;/code&gt; which is horizontal, we set the transform to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rotate(90deg)&lt;/code&gt; to set them all in a vertical position - &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;12:00:00&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transition-timing-function&lt;/code&gt; give the animated effect when changing the angle of the hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the javascript bits! We can break it down into the following steps - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the current time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract the hours, minutes and seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map the hours, minutes and seconds to corresponding degrees of the hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the hands&apos; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the whole loop should run every second, let&apos;s abstract the update logic in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setDate()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//get reference to the hands&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; secondHand &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.second-hand&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; minuteHand &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.min-hand&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; hourHand &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.hour-hand&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//logic to update the clock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;setDate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all the logic that goes into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setDate()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get the current time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; now &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extract the current sec, min, hour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; seconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; now&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; mins &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; now&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getMinutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; hours &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; now&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getHours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Map the time to degrees of the corresponding hands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; secondsDegrees &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; minsDegrees &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mins &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;seconds&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; hoursDegrees &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;hours &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mins&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the 90 represents 90 degrees that is to be added to set the hands to 12 O&apos;clock (which by default they point to 9 O&apos;clock). Rest is simple mapping from one range to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update the hand positions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;secondHand&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;transform &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`rotate(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;secondsDegrees&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;deg)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
minuteHand&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;transform &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`rotate(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;minsDegrees&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;deg)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
hourHand&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;transform &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`rotate(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;hoursDegrees&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;deg)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is pretty much it! Put it all together and you get the finished version of the clock. The codepen with the final code below -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;524&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-02-clock-b&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/VdzxWb/?height=524&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=css,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/VdzxWb/&apos;&gt;JS30-02-clock-b&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note I&apos;ve added the following style to make the min and hour hands separate lengths,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.min-hand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 35%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 15%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.hour-hand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 20%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 30%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

We will be building a simple app to play with CSS variables. Check the first few minuted of the video to find out what were building -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/undefined&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the codepen with the starter files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;455&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-03-css-vars-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/wXrwwO/?height=455&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=html,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/wXrwwO/&apos;&gt;JS30-03-css-vars-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At under 50 lines we have minimal, self explanatory starter code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part we&apos;ll be dealing with in the HTML is the user control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;controls&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;spacing&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Spacing:&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;base&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;color&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;base&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;#ffc600&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the border thickness and blur based on the sliders. Change the color of the border and heading to the &apos;Base Color&apos; picked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick intro to CSS variables -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Declaring a variable*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--main-bg-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; brown&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Using the variable */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--main-bg-color&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All variables start with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; and are followed by a value, it is like setting any other CSS property except that this value set can be accessed by using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var(--var-name)&lt;/code&gt;. Variables are also inherited (following the standard CSS cascading principles), variables defined at &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:root&lt;/code&gt; apply to all the other elements unless the variable is overridden by a closer ancestor. Let&apos;s take an example, assume we have the following HTML -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;one&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;two&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;three&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;four&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is our CSS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 10px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.three&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 2em&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results (note that the inheritance is similar to any other inheritable CSS property) -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the class=&quot;two&quot; element: 10px&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the class=&quot;three&quot; element: 2em&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the class=&quot;four&quot; element: 10px (inherited from its parent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the class=&quot;one&quot; element: invalid value, which is the default value of any custom property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the variable from JS -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//assuming :root is being set, else call setProperty on the specific element&lt;/span&gt;
document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;documentElement&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;--var-name&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;$val&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was taken from an example on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables&quot;&gt;MDN Docs&lt;/a&gt;, go there to learn more about CSS variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now to carry on with our web page, we can break it down into three parts -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the CSS properties to read from the variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set the CSS variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have three variables &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--base&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--spacing&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--blur&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; yellow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--spacing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 5px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--blur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--spacing&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--base&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;blur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--blur&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.hl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--base&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the styles are set by the variables, changing the variables would automatically update the styles wherever the variables were referenced!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capture the input&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to note, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;htmlElem.dataset&lt;/code&gt; gives us the object that contains key value pairs of all &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-*&lt;/code&gt; attributes.
Eg. If our element was &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div data-x=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot; data-y=&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we&apos;d get &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{&amp;#39;x&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;y&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;}&lt;/code&gt; and it is of type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;DOMStringMap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//get the list of all the input element&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; inputs &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.controls input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//doing it a bit differently than WesBos here, this way seems better&lt;/span&gt;
inputs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;input &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleUpdate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// we need to update the correct variable with the new value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// this =&gt; the element that generated the input event&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// check if the value needs to be suffixed with a unit&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; suffix &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dataset&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;sizing &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// this.name is the same as the CSS variable it should update&lt;/span&gt;
  document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;documentElement&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; suffix&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have a few lists and maps to work on (provided with the template), let&apos;s tackle the problems one by one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Array.prototype.filter()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].filter(test_fn)&lt;/code&gt; method creates a new array with all elements that pass the condition implemented by the provided function (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt;). Each element of the array is iterated upon and passed to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt; as an argument, if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test_fn&lt;/code&gt; returns a &quot;truthy&quot; for the element, it is included in the new list, if it returns a &quot;falsey&quot;, it is not.

&lt;h3&gt;Array.prototype.map()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].map(transform_fn)&lt;/code&gt; method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform_fn&lt;/code&gt;) on every element in the calling array.

&lt;p&gt;Task : &lt;strong&gt;Give us an array of the inventor first and last names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; names &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; inventors&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;inventor &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;inventor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;first&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;inventor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;last&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Array.prototype.sort()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].sort(cmp_fn)&lt;/code&gt; method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. You can pass an optional function as an argument (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cmp_fn&lt;/code&gt;), which will be used to compare two elements with each other. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cmp_fn(a,b)&lt;/code&gt; takes in two arguments - each being an element of the array being sorted.
The compare function -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should return a value lesser than 0 if &apos;a &amp;#x3C; b&apos;. (&apos;a&apos; will be placed at a lower index than &apos;b&apos;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should return a value equal to 0 if &apos;a == b&apos;    (&apos;a&apos; and &apos;b&apos; will remain where they are wrt each other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should return a value greater than 0 if &apos;a &gt; b&apos; (&apos;b&apos; will be places at a lower index than &apos;a&apos;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Array.prototype.reduce()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[].reduce(acc_fn [, init_val])&lt;/code&gt; method applies a function (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;acc_fn&lt;/code&gt;) against an accumulator (initial value being the first element of the array unless &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;init_val&lt;/code&gt; is passed) and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value. Example -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Convert the NodeList into an array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the above array, get the array of names of the Boulevards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter the ones with &apos;de&apos; in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

trans &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;elem &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;trans&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;elem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; trans&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;elem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; trans&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;elem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

To see the &lt;strong&gt;whole 30 part series&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;
We will be creating a panel based gallery with flexbox, CSS transitions and javascript. This is CSS heavy and the JS bits just add and removes classes from dom elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9eif30i26jg&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the following starter code :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;496&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-05-flex-gallery-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/mKqjVo/?height=496&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=css,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/mKqjVo/&apos;&gt;JS30-05-flex-gallery-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML is straightforward -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;panels&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;panel panel1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hey&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Let&apos;s&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Dance&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;panel panel2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole page content is held in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.panels&lt;/code&gt; element and each gallery item is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.panel&lt;/code&gt; element. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;panel1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;panel5&lt;/code&gt; classes just add the background. All positioning is done via Flexbox. In the CSS &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.panel&lt;/code&gt; definition, other than the basic styling, the most relevant bits for us is the transition property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.panel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; font-size 0.7s &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cubic-bezier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0.61, -0.19, 0.7, -0.11&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;,
            flex 0.7s &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cubic-bezier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0.61, -0.19, 0.7, -0.11&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;,
            background 0.2s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition property is applied to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;background&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now the panels are horizontally aligned, we want them to be vertical. For this, make the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;panels&lt;/code&gt; element a flex container. This makes the elements align vertically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.panels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; flex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to fix the spacing and alignment of the vertical elements -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.panel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; flex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; column&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here making &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;flex: 1&lt;/code&gt; ensures they spread out and take equal amount of space, making each panel itself a flex container would ensure that the text aligns in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the animation. First let&apos;s move the first and last &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of each panel above and below the screen respectively.
(Note : I&apos;ve done this slightly different than Wes Bos, he made each &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element a flex container and translated it up/down &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/code&gt;, where as I&apos;ve just moved them up/down &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;50vh&lt;/code&gt; without having to add any flex properties.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;panel &gt; *:first-child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;-50vh&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.panel.open-active &gt; *:first-child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.panel &gt; *:last-child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;50vh&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.panel.open-active &gt; *:last-child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the class &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;open-active&lt;/code&gt; is added to the panel, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s are moved back into view. Also the panel should get bigger when it&apos;s opened&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.panel.open&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 40px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 5&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt; increases from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2em&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;40px&lt;/code&gt; (over 0.7s) and the width increases to 5x of what it was before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes the CSS part of the animation. Try adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;open-active&lt;/code&gt; classes to one of the panels below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;495&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-05-flex-gallery-b&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/OEOwEy/?height=465&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=css,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/OEOwEy/&apos;&gt;JS30-05-flex-gallery-b&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to do the following in javascript!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen for &apos;click&apos; event on a panel, add the &apos;open&apos; class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen for &apos;transitionend&apos; and add the &apos;open-active&apos; class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first part -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggleOpen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;open&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.panel&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;panel &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; panel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; toggleOpen&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;second part -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggleActive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;propertyName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;flex&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;open-active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.panel&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;panel &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; panel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;transitionend&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; toggleActive&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That completes our web page! The final code&lt;/p&gt;

We will be creating a autocomplete dropdown for a search bar, the data being fetched via ajax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y4gZMJKAeWs&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starter files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;471&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-06-type-ahead-a&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/wXpmqv/?height=431&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=css,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/wXpmqv/&apos;&gt;JS30-06-type-ahead-a&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a JS heavy project, the HTML and CSS are rather simple, we don&apos;t have to bother with them much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;search-form&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;search&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;City or State&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;suggestions&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Filter for a city&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;or a state&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all the html we have to be concerned with. The CSS just styles the search bar and the dropdown elements (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ul.suggestions&lt;/code&gt;). Most of the visual effects are done through some simple box shadows, gradients and transforms. We don&apos;t have to touch any css for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to get the dropdown component working, we need to do the following things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have the url where we&apos;re getting the data from, fetch the json data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter the required elements from our data array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to user input in the search box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display the data in the dropdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fetching the data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; endpoint &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29/raw/2bf258763cdddd704f8ffd3ea9a3e81d25e2c6f6/cities.json&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; cities &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;endpoint&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;blob &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; blob&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cities &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will fetch the data from the endpoint, get a promise that will resolve to a response object, then we get the json data from that (well, another promise that resolves to the data we need). A sample json element -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    city&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;New York&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    growth_from_2000_to_2013&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4.8%&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    latitude&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;40.7127837&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    longitude&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;74.0059413&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    population&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;8405837&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    rank&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;New York&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Filter the required elements from our data array.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll be using a regex on every element of the cities array and filter out matching elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;findMatches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;wordToMatch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; cities&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; cities&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;place &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// here we need to figure out if the city or state matches what was searched&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; regex &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;RegExp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;wordToMatch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gi&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; place&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;city&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;regex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; place&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;regex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// if the regex was present, we match returns a match object, else null&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RegExp()&lt;/code&gt; object and not the standard notation of the js regex (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/regex-here/&lt;/code&gt;) since we are matching by the variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wordToMatch&lt;/code&gt;. There is no way to insert a variable in the regex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listen to user input in the search box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;displayMatches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// to be implemented&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; searchInput &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.search&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

searchInput&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;change&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; displayMatches&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
searchInput&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;keyup&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; displayMatches&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is as straightforward as attaching the event listeners on change and keyup on the search bar. Every time the user types something, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;displayMatches&lt;/code&gt; is triggered and it updates the dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Display the data in the dropdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we&apos;ll be implementing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;displayMatches&lt;/code&gt; function. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.value&lt;/code&gt; holds the current text in the search input field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the matching cities / states for the current input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert the array of matching items into html equivalent (for the dropdown)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the generated html under &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.suggestions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; suggestions &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.suggestions&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;displayMatches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// step 1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; matchArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;findMatches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; cities&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// step 2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; html &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; matchArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;place &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; regex &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;RegExp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gi&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes the features we need to make this functional. But we&apos;ll add a few more cosmetic touches - such as highlighting the matching text of the city/state name and also comma separating the numbers separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;numberWithCommas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That completes our app! Here is the final code -&lt;/p&gt;

We will be building a &quot;drumkit&quot; as shown in the first two minutes of the video below. The page plays certain sound effects on pressing keys from A to L on the qwerty keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;embed-container&apos;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VuN8qwZoego&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a codepen with the starter files (I have made &lt;em&gt;slight&lt;/em&gt; modifications to the pens since it&apos;s not running on the local filesystem) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s have a look at the HTML content. The structure is rather simple - the main content is in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.keys&lt;/code&gt; tag which contains the all the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.key&lt;/code&gt; elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;keys&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;65&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;sound&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;clap&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;83&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kbd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;S&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kbd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;sound&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hihat&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    ...
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.key&lt;/code&gt; element displays the letter and corresponding sound beat. The key get&apos;s animated when the corresponding key is pressed on the keyboard. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;kbd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is essentially a span which is supposed to signify &quot;user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device&quot;, it&apos;s more to do with semantics than anything else! You can read more about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd&quot;&gt;MDN docs page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags, these contain the links to the audio files that are to be played on the correct key presses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;65&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;sounds/clap.wav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;83&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;sounds/hihat.wav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;68&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;sounds/kick.wav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  ...
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;76&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;sounds/tink.wav&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;The HTML &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the &amp;lt;source&amp;gt; element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream. The `&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;` tag does not render unless there is a `controls` attribute present.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-key&lt;/code&gt; properties you see are custom attributes which you can add to HTML elements. The general format is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-*&lt;/code&gt;. This allows us to associate custom data to HTML elements (without colliding with standard attributes) in a way it can be accessed by CSS selectors and programmatically via javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HTML5 is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning. data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM, or Node.setUserData().&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes&quot;&gt;MDN docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSS is pretty straightforward, here are the interesting bits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.keys&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/*
  set display to flex
  cover the whole viewport height
  // okay - not really interesting
*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/*  evenly spaced flex items */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; all .07s ease&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.playing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;1.1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #ffc600&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0 0 1rem #ffc600&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These main properties involved with the animation - the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; class, and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;playing&lt;/code&gt; class that does the transform. More about this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is what comes with the template, we have to write the javascript bits to get to the finished webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can brake the problem into three parts - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture the keystrokes - only letters from &apos;A&apos; to &apos;L&apos; on the qwerty keyboard, ignore the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play the corresponding sound on a valid keypress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animate the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;div.key&lt;/code&gt; element that corresponds to the letter pressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capture the keystrokes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can capture keystrokes by adding a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;keydown&lt;/code&gt; event listener to the window object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;keydown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// e is the event object&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;keyCode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Play the audio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event object has a keycode integer, which is the ascii value of the key pressed. This is where the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-*&lt;/code&gt; property becomes useful, we can select the elements based on keycode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;playSound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// selects the audio element where data-key=&quot;e.keyCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; audio &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`audio[data-key=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;keyCode&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;]`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//if there is no audio element with the corresponding keyCode, then don&apos;t do anything&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;audio&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//else reset the audio time and play it&lt;/span&gt;
  audio&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;currentTime &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
  audio&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;keydown&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; playSound&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element gives us an object of type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HTMLAudioElement&lt;/code&gt; which has access to the properties of &lt;audio&gt; elements, as well as methods to manipulate them. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.play()&lt;/code&gt; plays the audio file associated with the tag. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.currentTime = 0&lt;/code&gt; resets the audio time if it&apos;s already running, otherwise if you hold down a button, the audio wouldn&apos;t be played repeatedly because an previous instance is already playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the audio tag @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement&quot;&gt;MDN docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the codepen up to this point -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height=&apos;494&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos; title=&apos;JS30-01-DrumKit-b&apos; src=&apos;//codepen.io/deepakkarki/embed/bKRdGd/?height=434&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;default-tab=js,result&amp;embed-version=2&apos; frameborder=&apos;no&apos; allowtransparency=&apos;true&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%;&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki/pen/bKRdGd/&apos;&gt;JS30-01-DrumKit-b&lt;/a&gt; by Deepak Karki (&lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io/deepakkarki&apos;&gt;@deepakkarki&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;https://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Animate the keys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation is done via CSS transitions. In the JS code we just add and remove the class &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;playing&lt;/code&gt; to create the animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// will go in the playSound() function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`div[data-key=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;keyCode&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;]`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;playing&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we recall, the transitions take &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0.07&lt;/code&gt; seconds. We want to remove the class &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;playing&lt;/code&gt; right after the animation completes. Rather than hardcoding it as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0.07&lt;/code&gt; seconds in the code, we can just listen on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transitionend&lt;/code&gt; event to be triggered on the element. Let&apos;s create a function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;removeTransition&lt;/code&gt; to take care of this logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;removeTransition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//transitionend is triggered on a variety of properties, (border, box shadow, etc)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// just select one - in this case &apos;transform&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;propertyName &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;transform&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;playing&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; keys &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;.key&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
keys&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;transitionend&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; removeTransition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes this project, here is the final codepen -&lt;/p&gt;

This is something that I occasionally regret. I
am especially sorry that I did not experience the 8-bit computer era as it was
happening, because I think the people that first encountered computers when
they were relatively simple and constrained have a huge advantage over the rest
of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, (almost) everyone knows how to use a computer, but very few people, even
in the computing industry, grasp all of what is going on inside of any single
machine. There are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZRE7HIO3vk&quot;&gt;so many layers of
software&lt;/a&gt; doing so many different
things that one struggles to identify the parts that are essential. In 1983,
though, home computers were unsophisticated enough that a diligent person could
learn how a particular computer worked through and through. That person is
today probably less mystified than I am by all the abstractions that modern
operating systems pile on top of the hardware. I expect that these layers of
abstractions were easy to understand one by one as they were introduced; today,
new programmers have to try to understand them all by working top to bottom and
backward in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many famous programmers, particularly in the video game industry, started
programming games in childhood on 8-bit computers like the Apple II and the
Commodore 64. John Romero, Richard Garriott, and Chris Roberts are all
examples. It&apos;s easy to see how this happened. In the 8-bit computer era, many
games were available only as printed BASIC listings in computer magazines and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;. If you wanted to
play one of those games, you had to type in the whole program by hand.
Inevitably, you would get something wrong, so you would have to debug your
program. By the time you got it working, you knew enough about how the program
functioned to start modifying it yourself. If you were an avid gamer, you
became a good programmer almost by necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also played computer games throughout my childhood. But the games I played
came on CD-ROMs. I sometimes found myself having to google how to fix a
crashing installer, which would involve editing the Windows Registry or
something like that. This kind of minor troubleshooting may have made me
comfortable enough with computers to consider studying computer science in
college. But it never taught me anything crucial about how computers worked or
how to control them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, I tell computers what to do for a living. All the same, I can&apos;t
help feeling that I missed out on some fundamental insight afforded only to
those that grew up programming simpler computers. What would it have been like
to encounter computers for the first time in the early 1980s? How would that
have been different from the experience of using a computer today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to be a little different from the usual Two-Bit History post
because I&apos;m going to try to imagine an answer to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1983&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just last week that you saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZekAbt2o6Ms&quot;&gt;the Commodore 64
ad&lt;/a&gt; on TV. Now that &lt;em&gt;M&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;S*H&lt;/em&gt; was
over, you were in the market for something new to do on Monday nights. This
Commodore 64 thing looked even better than the Apple II that Rudy&apos;s family had
in their basement. Plus, the ad promised that the new computer would soon bring
friends &quot;knocking down&quot; your door. You knew several people at school that would
rather be hanging out at your house than Rudy&apos;s anyway, if only they could play
&lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you persuaded your parents to buy one. Your mother said that they would
consider it only if having a home computer meant that you stayed away from the
arcade. You reluctantly agreed. Your father thought he would start tracking the
family&apos;s finances in MultiPlan, the spreadsheet program he had heard about,
which is why the computer got put in the living room. A year later, though, you
would be the only one still using it. You were finally allowed to put it on the
desk in your bedroom, right under your &lt;em&gt;Police&lt;/em&gt; poster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Your sister protested this decision, but it was 1983 and computers
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding&quot;&gt;weren&apos;t for
her&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad picked it up from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA_XtT3VAVM&quot;&gt;ComputerLand&lt;/a&gt; on the way home
from work. The two of you laid the box down next to the TV and opened it.
&quot;WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF FRIENDLY COMPUTING,&quot; said the packaging. Twenty
minutes later, you weren&apos;t convinced—the two of you were still trying to
connect the Commodore to the TV set and wondering whether the TV&apos;s antenna
cable was the 75-ohm or 300-ohm coax type. But eventually you were able to turn
your TV to channel 3 and see a grainy, purple image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/c64_startup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Commodore 64 startup screen&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;READY&lt;/code&gt;, the computer reported. Your father pushed the computer toward you,
indicating that you should be the first to give it a try. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HELLO&lt;/code&gt;, you typed,
carefully hunting for each letter. The computer&apos;s response was baffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/c64_error.png&quot; alt=&quot;Commodore 64 syntax error&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You tried typing in a few different words, but the response was always the
same. Your father said that you had better read through the rest of the manual.
That would be no mean feat—&lt;a href=&quot;ftp://www.zimmers.net/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/C64_Users_Guide.pdf&quot;&gt;the manual that came with the Commodore
64&lt;/a&gt; was a small
book. But that didn&apos;t bother you, because the introduction to the manual
foreshadowed wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodore 64, it claimed, had &quot;the most advanced picture maker in the
microcomputer industry,&quot; which would allow you &quot;to design your own pictures in
four different colors, just like the ones you see on arcade type video games.&quot;
The Commodore 64 also had &quot;built-in music and sound effects that rival many
well known music synthesizers.&quot; All of these tools would be put in your hands,
because the manual would walk you through it all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as important as all the available hardware is the fact that this USER&apos;S
GUIDE will help you develop your understanding of computers. It won&apos;t tell
you everything there is to know about computers, but it will refer you to a
wide variety of publications for more detailed information about the topics
presented. Commodore wants you to really enjoy your new COMMODORE 64. And to
have fun, remember: programming is not the kind of thing you can learn in a
day. Be patient with yourself as you go through the USER&apos;S GUIDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, in bed, you read through the entire first three chapters—&quot;Setup,&quot;
&quot;Getting Started,&quot; and &quot;Beginning BASIC Programming&quot;—before finally succumbing
to sleep with the manual splayed across your chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodore BASIC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&apos;s Saturday morning and you&apos;re eager to try out what you&apos;ve learned. One
of the first things the manual teaches you how to do is change the colors on
the display. You follow the instructions, pressing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CTRL-9&lt;/code&gt; to enter reverse
type mode and then holding down the space bar to create long lines. You swap
between colors using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CTRL-1&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CTRL-8&lt;/code&gt;, reveling in your sudden new
power over the TV screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/c64_colors.png&quot; alt=&quot;Commodore 64 color bands&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cool as this is, you realize it doesn&apos;t count as programming. In order to
program the computer, you learned last night, you have to speak to it in a
language called BASIC. To you, BASIC seems like something out of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;,
but BASIC is, by 1983, almost two decades old. It was invented by two Dartmouth
professors, John Kemeny and Tom Kurtz, who wanted to make computing accessible
to undergraduates in the social sciences and humanities. It was widely
available on minicomputers and popular in college math classes. It then became
standard on microcomputers after Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote the MicroSoft
BASIC interpreter for the Altair. But the manual doesn&apos;t explain any of this
and you won&apos;t learn it for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first BASIC commands the manual suggests you try is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt;
command. You type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PRINT &amp;quot;COMMODORE 64&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, slowly, since it takes you a while
to find the quotation mark symbol above the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; key. You hit &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; and this
time, instead of complaining, the computer does exactly what you told it to do
and displays &quot;COMMODORE 64&quot; on the next line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you try using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; command on all sorts of different things: two
numbers added together, two numbers multiplied together, even several
decimal numbers. You stop typing out &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; and instead use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, since the
manual has advised you that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; is an abbreviation for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; often used by
expert programmers. You feel like an expert already, but then you remember that
you haven&apos;t even made it to chapter three, &quot;Beginning BASIC Programming.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get there soon enough. The chapter begins by prompting you to write your
first real BASIC program. You type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NEW&lt;/code&gt; and hit &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt;, which gives you a
clean slate. You then type your program in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;10 ?&amp;quot;COMMODORE 64&amp;quot;
20 GOTO 10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 and the 20, the manual explains, are line numbers. They order the
statements for the computer. They also allow the programmer to refer to other
lines of the program in certain commands, just like you&apos;ve done here with the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt; command, which directs the program back to line 10. &quot;It is good
programming practice,&quot; the manual opines, &quot;to number lines in increments of
10—in case you need to insert some statements later on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; and stare as the screen clogs with &quot;COMMODORE 64,&quot; repeated over
and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/c64_print_loop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Commodore 64 showing result of printing &amp;#x22;Commodore 64&amp;#x22;
repeatedly&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;re not certain that this isn&apos;t going to blow up your computer. It takes you
a second to remember that you are supposed to hit the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RUN/STOP&lt;/code&gt; key to break
the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few sections of the manual teach you about variables, which the manual
tells you are like &quot;a number of boxes within the computer that can each hold a
number or a string of text characters.&quot; Variables that end in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; symbol are
whole numbers, while variables ending in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; symbol are strings of
characters. All other variables are something called &quot;floating point&quot;
variables. The manual warns you to be careful with variable names because only
the first two letters of the name are actually recognized by the computer, even
though nothing stops you from making a name as long as you want it to be. (This
doesn&apos;t particularly bother you, but you could see how 30 years from now this
might strike someone as completely insane.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You then learn about the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IF... THEN...&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FOR... NEXT...&lt;/code&gt; constructs. With
all these new tools, you feel equipped to tackle the next big challenge the
manual throws at you. &quot;If you&apos;re the ambitious type,&quot; it goads, &quot;type in the
following program and see what happens.&quot; The program is longer and more
complicated than any you have seen so far, but you&apos;re dying to know what it
does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;10  REM BOUNCING BALL
20  PRINT &amp;quot;{CLR/HOME}&amp;quot;
25  FOR X = 1 TO 10 : PRINT &amp;quot;{CRSR/DOWN}&amp;quot; : NEXT
30  FOR BL = 1 TO 40
40  PRINT &amp;quot; ●{CRSR LEFT}&amp;quot;;:REM (● is a Shift-Q)
50  FOR TM = 1 TO 5
60  NEXT TM
70  NEXT BL
75  REM MOVE BALL RIGHT TO LEFT
80  FOR BL = 40 TO 1 STEP -1
90  PRINT &amp;quot; {CRSR LEFT}{CRSR LEFT}●{CRSR LEFT}&amp;quot;;
100 FOR TM = 1 TO 5
110 NEXT TM
120 NEXT BL
130 GOTO 20&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program above takes advantage of one of the Commodore 64&apos;s coolest
features. Non-printable command characters, when passed to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; command
as part of a string, just do the action they usually perform instead of
printing to the screen. This allows you to replay arbitrary chains of commands
by printing strings from within your programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes you a long time to type in the above program. You make several
mistakes and have to re-enter some of the lines. But eventually you are able to
type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; and behold a masterpiece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/c64_ball.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Commodore 64 bouncing ball&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think that this is a major contender for the coolest thing you have ever
seen. You forget about it almost immediately though, because once you&apos;ve
learned about BASIC&apos;s built-in functions like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RND&lt;/code&gt; (which returns a random
number) and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CHR$&lt;/code&gt; (which returns the character matching a given number code),
the manual shows you a program that many years from now will still be
famous enough to be made the title of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://10print.org/&quot;&gt;essay
anthology&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;10 PRINT &amp;quot;{CLR/HOME}&amp;quot;
20 PRINT CHR$(205.5 + RND(1));
40 GOTO 20&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When run, the above program produces a random maze:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/c64_maze.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Commodore 64 maze program&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is definitely the coolest thing you have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PEEK and POKE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ve now made it through the first four chapters of the Commodore 64 manual,
including the chapter titled &quot;Advanced BASIC,&quot; so you&apos;re feeling pretty proud
of yourself. You&apos;ve learned a lot this Saturday morning. But this afternoon
(after a quick lunch break), you&apos;re going to learn something that will make
this magical machine in your living room much less mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next chapter in the manual is titled &quot;Advanced Color and Graphic Commands.&quot;
It starts off by revisiting the colored bars that you were able to type out
first thing this morning and shows you how you can do the same thing from a
program. It then teaches you how to change the background colors of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, you need to use the BASIC &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PEEK&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;POKE&lt;/code&gt; commands.
Those commands allow you to, respectively, examine and write to a memory
address. The Commodore 64 has a main background color and a border color. Each
is controlled by a specially designated memory address. You can write any color
value you would like to those addresses to make the background or border that
color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as variables can be thought of as a representation of &quot;boxes&quot; within the
machine where you placed your information, you can also think of some
specially defined &quot;boxes&quot; within the computer that represent specific memory
locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodore 64 looks at these memory locations to see what the screen&apos;s
background and border color should be, what characters are to be displayed on
the screen—and where—and a host of other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You write a program to cycle through all the available combinations of
background and border color:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;10 FOR BA = 0 TO 15
20 FOR BO = 0 TO 15
30 POKE 53280, BA
40 POKE 53281, BO
50 FOR X = 1 TO 500 : NEXT X
60 NEXT BO : NEXT BA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;POKE&lt;/code&gt; commands, with their big operands, looked intimidating at
first, now you see that the actual value of the number doesn&apos;t matter that
much. Obviously, you have to get the number right, but all the number
represents is a &quot;box&quot; that Commodore just happened to store at address 53280.
This box has a special purpose: Commodore uses it to determine what color the
screen&apos;s background should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/c64_background.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Commodore 64 changing background colors&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think this is pretty neat. Just by writing to a special-purpose box in
memory, you can control a fundamental property of the computer. You aren&apos;t
sure how the Commodore 64&apos;s circuitry takes the value you write in memory and
changes the color of the screen, but you&apos;re okay not knowing that. At least you
understand everything up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Special Boxes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t get through the entire manual that Saturday, since you are now
starting to run out of steam. But you do eventually read all of it. In the
process, you learn about many more of the Commodore 64&apos;s special-purpose boxes.
There are boxes you can write to control what is on screen—one box, in fact,
for every place a character might appear. In chapter six, &quot;Sprite Graphics,&quot;
you learn about the special-purpose boxes that allow you to define images that
can be moved around and even scaled up and down. In chapter seven, &quot;Creating
Sound,&quot; you learn about the boxes you can write to in order to make your
Commodore 64 sing &quot;Michael Row the Boat Ashore.&quot; The Commodore 64, it turns
out, has very little in the way of what you would later learn is called an API.
Controlling the Commodore 64 mostly involves writing to memory addresses that
have been given special meaning by the circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The many years you ultimately spend writing to those special boxes stick with
you. Even many decades later, when you find yourself programming a machine with
an extensive graphics or sound API, you know that, behind the curtain, the API
is ultimately writing to those boxes or something like them. You will sometimes
wonder about younger programmers that have only ever used APIs, and wonder what
they must think the API is doing for them. Maybe they think that the API is
calling some other, hidden API. But then what do think that hidden API is
calling? You will pity those younger programmers, because they must be very
confused indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

computing history. In 1975, Paul Allen flew out to Albuquerque to demonstrate
the BASIC interpreter that he and Bill Gates had written for the Altair
microcomputer. Because neither of them had a working Altair, Allen and Gates
tested their interpreter using an emulator that they wrote and ran on Harvard&apos;s
computer system. The emulator was based on nothing more than the published
specifications for the Intel 8080 processor. When Allen finally ran their
interpreter on a real Altair—in front of the person he and Gates hoped would
buy their software—he had no idea if it would work. But it did. The next month,
Allen and Gates officially founded their new company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a century before Allen and Gates wrote their BASIC interpreter, Ada
Lovelace wrote and published a computer program. She, too, wrote a program for
a computer that had only been described to her. But her program, unlike the
Microsoft BASIC interpreter, was never run, because the computer she was
targeting was never built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovelace&apos;s program is often called the world&apos;s first computer program. Not
everyone agrees that it should be called that. Lovelace&apos;s legacy, it turns out,
is one of computing history&apos;s most hotly debated subjects. Walter Isaacson has
written that the dispute about the extent and merit of her contributions
constitutes a &quot;minor academic specialty.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Inevitably, the fact that
Lovelace was a woman has made this dispute a charged one. Historians have cited
all kinds of primary evidence to argue that the credit given to Lovelace is
either appropriate or undeserved. But they seem to spend less time explaining
the technical details of her published writing, which is unfortunate, because
the technical details are the most fascinating part of the story. Who wouldn&apos;t
want to know exactly how a program written in 1843 was supposed to work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, Lovelace&apos;s program is not easy to explain to the layperson without
some hand-waving. It&apos;s the intricacies of her program, though, that make it so
remarkable. Whether or not she ought to be known as &quot;the first programmer,&quot; her
program was specified with a degree of rigor that far surpassed anything that
came before. She thought carefully about how operations could be organized into
groups that could be repeated, thereby inventing the loop. She realized how
important it was to track the state of variables as they changed, introducing a
notation to illustrate those changes. As a programmer myself, I&apos;m startled to
see how much of what Lovelace was doing resembles the experience of writing
software today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&apos;s take a closer look at Lovelace&apos;s program. She designed it to calculate
the Bernoulli numbers. To understand what those are, we have to go back a
couple millennia to the genesis of one of mathematics&apos; oldest problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sums of Powers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pythagoreans lived on the shores of the Mediterranean and worshiped
numbers. One of their pastimes was making triangles out of pebbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/triangular_numbers1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pebble followed by a row of two pebbles makes a triangle
containing three pebbles. Add another row of three pebbles and you get a
triangle containing six pebbles. You can continue like this, each time adding a
row with one more pebble in it than the previous row. A triangle with six rows
contains 21 pebbles. But how many pebbles does a triangle with 423 rows
contain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Pythagoreans were looking for was a way to calculate the following
without doing all the addition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They eventually realized that, if you place two triangles of the same size up
against each other so that they form a rectangle, you can find the area of the
rectangle and divide by two to get the number of pebbles in each of the
triangles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might visualize this series by imagining a stack of progressively larger
squares (made out of tiny cubes), one on top of the other, forming a pyramid.
Archimedes wanted to know if there was an easy way to tell how many cubes would
be needed to construct a pyramid with, say, 423 levels. He recorded a solution
that also permits a geometrical interpretation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three pyramids can be fit together to form a rectangular prism with a tiny,
one-cube-high extrusion at one end. That little extrusion happens to be a
triangle that obeys the same rules that the Pythagoreans used to make their
pebble triangles. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXbT37IlyZQ&quot;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt;
might be a more helpful explanation of what I mean.) So the volume of the whole
shape is given by the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A formula for the sum of the first &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; positive integers raised to the fourth
power wasn&apos;t published for another 500 years.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering at this point if there is a general method for finding
the sum of the first &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; integers raised to the &lt;em&gt;kth&lt;/em&gt; power.
Mathematicians were wondering too. Johann Faulhaber, a German mathematician and
slightly kooky numerologist, was able to calculate formulas for sums of
integers up to the 17th power, which he published in 1631. But this may have
taken him years and he did not state a general solution.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Blaise Pascal
finally outlined a general method in 1665, though it depended on first knowing
how to calculate the sum of integers raised to every lesser power.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To
calculate the sum of the first &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; positive integers raised to the sixth power,
for example, you would first have to know how to calculate the sum of the first
&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; positive integers raised to the fifth power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more practical general solution was stated in the posthumously published work
of Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli, who died in 1705. Bernoulli began by
deriving the formulas for calculating the sums of the first &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; positive
integers to the first, second, and third powers.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These he gave in
polynomial form, so they looked like the below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Pascal&apos;s Triangle, Bernoulli realized that these polynomials followed a
predictable pattern. Essentially, Bernoulli broke the coefficients of each
term down into two factors, one of which he could determine using Pascal&apos;s
Triangle and the other which he could derive from the interesting property that
all the coefficients in the polynomial seemed to always add to one. Figuring
out the exponent that should be attached to each term was no problem,
because that also followed a predictable pattern. The factor of each
coefficient that had to be calculated using the sums-to-one rule formed a
sequence that became known as the Bernoulli numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernoulli&apos;s discovery did not mean that it was now trivial to calculate the sum
of the first positive &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; integers to any given power. In order to calculate
the sum of the first positive &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; integers raised to the &lt;em&gt;kth&lt;/em&gt; power,
you would need to know every Bernoulli number up to the &lt;em&gt;kth&lt;/em&gt; Bernoulli
number. Each Bernoulli number could only be calculated if the previous
Bernoulli numbers were known. But calculating a long series of Bernoulli
numbers was significantly easier than deriving each sum of powers formula in
turn, so Bernoulli&apos;s discovery was a big advance for mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Babbage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Babbage was born in 1791, nearly a century after Bernoulli died. I&apos;ve
always had some vague idea that Babbage designed but did not build a mechanical
computer. But I&apos;ve never entirely understood how that computer was supposed to
work. The basic ideas, as it happens, are not that difficult to grasp, which is
good news. Lovelace&apos;s program was designed to run on one of Babbage&apos;s machines,
so we need to take another quick detour here to talk about how those machines
worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babbage designed two separate mechanical computing machines. His first machine
was called the Difference Engine. Before the invention of the pocket
calculator, people relied on logarithmic tables to calculate the product of
large numbers. (There is a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VRzH4xB0GdM&quot;&gt;Numberphile
video&lt;/a&gt; on how this was done.) Large logarithmic
tables are not difficult to create, at least conceptually, but the sheer number
of calculations that need to be done in order to create them meant that in
Babbage&apos;s time they often contained errors. Babbage, frustrated by this, sought
to create a machine that could tabulate logarithms mechanically and therefore
without error.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Difference Engine was not a computer, because all it did was add and
subtract. It took advantage of a method devised by the French mathematician
Gaspard de Prony that broke the process of tabulating logarithms down into
small steps.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These small steps involved only addition and subtraction,
meaning that a small army of people without any special mathematical aptitude
or training could be employed to produce a table. De Prony&apos;s method, known as
the method of divided differences, could be used to tabulate any polynomial.
Polynomials, in turn, could be used to approximate logarithmic and
trigonometric functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how this process worked, consider the following simple
polynomial function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;y = x^2 + 1&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03588em;&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.897438em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.8141079999999999em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mtight&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mbin&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method of divided differences involves finding the difference between each
successive value of &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; for different values of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;. The differences
between these differences are then found, and possibly the differences between
those next differences themselves, until a constant difference appears. These
differences can then be used to get the next value of the polynomial simply by
adding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the above polynomial is only a second-degree polynomial, we are able to
find the constant difference after only two columns of differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;max-width:480px; margin:auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;x&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;y&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Diff 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Diff 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, since we know that the constant difference is 2, we can find the value of
&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is 5 through addition only. If we add 2 to 7, the last entry in
the &quot;Diff 1&quot; column, we get 9. If we add 9 to 17, the last entry in the &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;
column, we get 26, our answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babbage&apos;s Difference Engine had, for each difference column in a table like the
one above, a physical column of gears. Each gear was a decimal digit and one
whole column was a decimal number. The Difference Engine had eight columns of
gears, so it could tabulate a polynomial up to the seventh degree. The columns
were initially set with values matching an early row in the difference table,
worked out ahead of time. A human operator would then turn a crank shaft,
causing the constant difference to propagate through the machine as the value
stored on each column was added to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babbage was able to build a small section of the Difference Engine and use it
to demonstrate his ideas at parties.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But even after spending an amount of
public money equal to the cost of two large warships, he never built the entire
machine.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Babbage could not find anyone in the early 1800s that could make
the number of gears he needed with sufficient accuracy. A working Difference
Engine would not be built until the 1990s, after the advent of precision
machining. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlbQsKpq3Ak&quot;&gt;a great video on
YouTube&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating a working
Difference Engine on loan to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View,
which is worth watching even just to listen to the marvelous sounds the machine
makes while it runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babbage eventually lost interest in the Difference Engine when he realized that
a much more powerful and flexible machine could be built. His Analytical Engine
was the machine that we know today as Babbage&apos;s mechanical computer. The
Analytical Engine was based on the same columns of gears used in the Difference
Engine, but whereas the Difference Engine only had eight columns, the
Analytical Engine was supposed to have many hundreds more. The Analytical
Engine could be programmed using punched cards like a Jacquard Loom and could
multiply and divide as well as add and subtract. In order to perform one of
these operations, a section of the machine called the &quot;mill&quot; would rearrange
itself into the appropriate configuration, read the operands off of other
columns used for data storage, and then write the result back to another
column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babbage called his new machine the Analytical Engine because it was powerful
enough to do something resembling mathematical analysis. The Difference Engine
could tabulate a polynomial, but the Analytical Engine would be able to
calculate, for example, the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of another
expression. It was an amazing machine, but the British government wisely
declined to fund its construction. So Babbage went abroad to Italy to try to
drum up support for his idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes by The Translator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Turin, Babbage met Italian engineer and future prime minister Luigi
Menabrea. He persuaded Menabrea to write an outline of what the Analytical
Engine could accomplish. In 1842, Menabrea published a paper on the topic in
French. The following year, Lovelace published a translation of Menabrea&apos;s
paper into English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovelace, then known as Ada Byron, first met Babbage at a party in 1833, when
she was 17 and he was 41.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-11&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lovelace was fascinated with Babbage&apos;s
Difference Engine. She could also understand how it worked, because she had
been extensively tutored in mathematics throughout her childhood. Her mother,
Annabella Milbanke, had decided that a solid grounding in mathematics would
ward off the wild, romantic sensibility that possessed Lovelace&apos;s father, Lord
Byron, the famous poet. After meeting in 1833, Lovelace and Babbage remained a
part of the same social circle and wrote to each other frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada Byron married William King in 1835. King later became the Earl of Lovelace,
making Ada the Countess of Lovelace. Even after having three children, she
continued her education in mathematics, employing Augustus de Morgan, who
discovered De Morgan&apos;s laws, as her tutor.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-12&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lovelace saw the potential of
Babbage&apos;s Analytical Machine immediately and was eager to work with him to
promote the idea. A friend suggested that she translate Menabrea&apos;s paper for an
English audience.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-13&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menabrea&apos;s paper gave a brief overview of how the Difference Engine worked,
then showed how the Analytical Engine would be a far superior machine. The
Analytical Engine would be so powerful that it could &quot;form the product of two
numbers, each containing twenty figures, in &lt;em&gt;three minutes&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-14&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (emphasis in
the original). Menabrea gave further examples of the machine&apos;s capabilities,
demonstrating how it could solve a simple system of linear equations and
expand the product of two binomial expressions. In both cases, Menabrea
provided what Lovelace called &quot;diagrams of development,&quot; which listed the
sequence of operations that would need to be performed to calculate the correct
answer.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-15&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These were programs in the same sense that Lovelace&apos;s own program
was a program and they were originally published the year before. But as we
will see, Menabrea&apos;s programs were only simple examples of what was possible.
All of them were trivial in the sense that they did not require any kind of
branching or looping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovelace appended a series of notes to her translation of Menabrea&apos;s paper that
together ran much longer than the original work. It was here that she made her
major contributions to computing. In Note A, which Lovelace attached to
Menabrea&apos;s initial description of the Analytical Engine, Lovelace explained at
some length and often in lyrical language the promise of a machine that could
perform arbitrary mathematical operations. She foresaw that a machine like the
Analytical Engine wasn&apos;t just limited to numbers and could in fact act on
any objects &quot;whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of
the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of
adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the
engine.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-16&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She added that the machine might one day, for example, compose
music. This insight was all the more remarkable given that Menabrea saw the
Analytical Engine primarily as a tool for automating &quot;long and arid
computation,&quot; which would free up the intellectual capacities of brilliant
scientists for more advanced thinking.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-17&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The miraculous foresight that
Lovelace demonstrated in Note A is one major reason that she is celebrated
today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other famous note is Note G. Lovelace begins Note G by arguing that,
despite its impressive powers, the Analytical Machine cannot really be said to
&quot;think.&quot; This part of Note G is what Alan Turing would later refer to as &quot;Lady
Lovelace&apos;s Objection.&quot; Nevertheless, Lovelace continues, the machine can do
extraordinary things. To illustrate its ability to handle even more complex
problems, Lovelace provides her program calculating the Bernoulli numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full program, in the expanded &quot;diagram of development&quot; format that Lovelace
explains in Note D, can be seen
&lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Diagram_for_the_computation_of_Bernoulli_numbers.jpg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The program is essentially a list of operations, specified using the usual
mathematical symbols. It doesn&apos;t appear that Babbage or Lovelace got as far as
developing anything like a set of op codes for the Analytical Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lovelace was describing a method for computing the entire sequence of
Bernoulli numbers up to some limit, the program she provided only illustrated
one step of that process. Her program calculated a number that she called B7,

&lt;p&gt;In the above, each term represents a coefficient in the polynomial formula for
the sum of integers to a particular power. Here that power is eight, since the
eighth Bernoulli number first appears in the formula for the sum of positive
integers to the eighth power. The B and A numbers represent the two kinds of
factors that Bernoulli discovered. B1 through B7 are all different Bernoulli
numbers, indexed according to Lovelace&apos;s indexing. A0 through A5 represent the
factors of the coefficients that Bernoulli could calculate using Pascal&apos;s
Triangle. The values of A0, A1, A3, and A5 appear below. Here &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; represents
the index of the Bernoulli number in the sequence of odd-numbered Bernoulli
numbers starting with the first. Lovelace&apos;s program used &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve created a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/sinclairtarget/ad18ac65d277e453da5f479d6ccfc20e&quot;&gt;translation&lt;/a&gt;
of Lovelace&apos;s program into C, which may be easier to follow. Lovelace&apos;s program
first calculates A0 and the product B1A1. It then enters a loop that repeats
twice to calculate B3A3 and B5A5, since those are formed according to an
identical pattern. After each product is calculated, it is added with all the
previous products, so that by the end of the program the full sum has been
obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the C translation is not an exact recreation of Lovelace&apos;s program.
It declares variables on the stack, for example, whereas Lovelace&apos;s variables
were more like registers. But it makes obvious the parts of Lovelace&apos;s program
that were so prescient. The C program contains two &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops, one nested
inside the other. Lovelace&apos;s program did not have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops exactly, but
she made groups of operations and in the text of her note specified when they
should repeat. The variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v10&lt;/code&gt;, in the original program and in the C
translation, functions as a counter variable that decrements with each loop, a
construct any programmer would be familiar with. In fact, aside from the
profusion of variables with unhelpful names, the C translation of Lovelace&apos;s
program doesn&apos;t look that alien at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing worth mentioning quickly is that translating Lovelace&apos;s program
into C was not that difficult, thanks to the detail present in her diagram.
Unlike Menabrea&apos;s tables, her table includes a column labeled &quot;Indication of
change in the value on any Variable,&quot; which makes it much easier to follow the
mutation of state throughout the program. She adds a superscript index here to
each variable to indicate the successive values they hold. A superscript of
two, for example, means that the value being used here is the second value that
has been assigned to the variable since the beginning of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The First Programmer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had translated Lovelace&apos;s program into C, I was able to run it on my
own computer. To my frustration, I kept getting the wrong result. After some
debugging, I finally realized that the problem wasn&apos;t the code that I had
written. The bug was in the original!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her &quot;diagram of development,&quot; Lovelace gives the fourth operation as
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v5 / v4&lt;/code&gt;. But the correct ordering here is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v4 / v5&lt;/code&gt;. This may well have been
a typesetting error and not an error in the program that Lovelace devised. All
the same, this must be the oldest bug in computing. I marveled that, for ten
minutes or so, unknowingly, I had wrestled with this first ever bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Randall, another blogger that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://enigmaticcode.wordpress.com/tag/bernoulli-numbers/&quot;&gt;translated Lovelace&apos;s program into
Python&lt;/a&gt;, has noted
this division bug and two other issues. What does it say about Ada Lovelace
that her published program contains minor bugs? Perhaps it shows that she
was attempting to write not just a demonstration but a real program. After all,
can you really be writing anything more than toy programs if you aren&apos;t also
writing lots of bugs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Wikipedia article calls Lovelace the first to publish a &quot;complex
program.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-18&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Maybe that&apos;s the right way to think about Lovelace&apos;
accomplishment. Menabrea published &quot;diagrams of development&quot; in his paper a
year before Lovelace published her translation. Babbage also wrote more than
twenty programs that he never published.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-19&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So it&apos;s not quite accurate to say
that Lovelace wrote or published the first program, though there&apos;s always room
to quibble about what exactly constitutes a &quot;program.&quot; Even so, Lovelace&apos;s
program was miles ahead of anything else that had been published before. The
longest program that Menabrea presented was 11 operations long and contained no
loops or branches; Lovelace&apos;s program contains 25 operations and a nested loop
(and thus branching). Menabrea wrote the following toward the end of his paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When once the engine shall have been constructed, the difficulty will be
reduced to the making of the cards; but as these are merely the translation
of algebraic formulae, it will, by means of some simple notation, be easy to
consign the execution of them to a workman.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-20&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Babbage nor Menabrea were especially interested in applying the
Analytical Engine to problems beyond the immediate mathematical challenges that
first drove Babbage to construct calculating machines. Lovelace saw that the
Analytical Engine was capable of much more than Babbage or Menabrea could
imagine. Lovelace also grasped that &quot;the making of the cards&quot; would not be a
mere afterthought and that it could be done well or done poorly. This is hard
to appreciate without understanding her program from Note G and seeing for
oneself the care she put into designing it. But having done that, you might
agree that Lovelace, even if she was not the very first programmer, was the
first programmer to deserve the title.&lt;/p&gt;

As far as I can
gather, Intel HEX files (which use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.hex&lt;/code&gt; extension) are meant to make
binary images less opaque by encoding them as lines of hexadecimal digits.
Apparently they are used by people who program microcontrollers or need to burn
data into ROM. In any case, when I opened up a HEX file in Vim for the first
time, I discovered something shocking. Here was this file format that, at least
to me, was deeply esoteric, but Vim already knew all about it. Each line of a
HEX file is a record divided into different fields—Vim had gone ahead and
colored each of the fields a different color. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;set ft?&lt;/code&gt; I asked, in awe.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;filetype=hex&lt;/code&gt;, Vim answered, triumphant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim is everywhere. It is used by so many people that something like HEX file
support shouldn&apos;t be a surprise. Vim comes pre-installed on Mac OS and has a
large constituency in the Linux world. It is familiar even to people that hate
it, because enough popular command line tools will throw users into Vim by
default that the uninitiated getting trapped in Vim has become &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/meme.jpeg&quot;&gt;a
meme&lt;/a&gt;. There
are major websites, including Facebook, that will scroll down when you press
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; key and up when you press the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; key—the unlikely high-water mark of
Vim&apos;s spread through digital culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet Vim is also a mystery. Unlike React, for example, which everyone knows
is developed and maintained by Facebook, Vim has no obvious sponsor. Despite
its ubiquity and importance, there doesn&apos;t seem to be any kind of committee or
organization that makes decisions about Vim. You could spend several minutes
poking around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim website&lt;/a&gt; without getting a better
idea of who created Vim or why. If you launch Vim without giving it a file
argument, then you will see Vim&apos;s startup message, which says that Vim is
developed by &quot;Bram Moolenaar et al.&quot; But that doesn&apos;t tell you much. Who is
Bram Moolenaar and who are his shadowy confederates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, while we&apos;re asking questions, why does exiting Vim
involve typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt;? Sure, it&apos;s a &quot;write&quot; operation followed by a &quot;quit&quot;
operation, but that is not a particularly intuitive convention. Who decided
that copying text should instead be called &quot;yanking&quot;? Why is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:%s/foo/bar/gc&lt;/code&gt;
short for &quot;find and replace&quot;? Vim&apos;s idiosyncrasies seem too arbitrary to have
been made up, but then where did they come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, as is so often the case, begins with that ancient crucible of
computing, Bell Labs. In some sense, Vim is only the latest iteration of a
piece of software—call it the &quot;wq text editor&quot;—that has been continuously
developed and improved since the dawn of the Unix epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ken Thompson Writes a Line Editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, Bell Labs hired Ken Thompson. Thompson had just completed a Master&apos;s
degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of
California, Berkeley. While there, he had used a text editor called QED,
written for the Berkeley Timesharing System between 1965 and 1966.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One of
the first things Thompson did after arriving at Bell Labs was rewrite QED for
the MIT Compatible Time-Sharing System. He would later write another version of
QED for the Multics project. Along the way, he expanded the program so that
users could search for lines in a file and make substitutions using regular
expressions.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Multics project, which like the Berkeley Timesharing System sought to
create a commercially viable time-sharing operating system, was a partnership
between MIT, General Electric, and Bell Labs. AT&amp;#x26;T eventually decided the
project was going nowhere and pulled out. Thompson and fellow Bell Labs
researcher Dennis Ritchie, now without access to a time-sharing system and
missing the &quot;feel of interactive computing&quot; that such systems offered, set
about creating their own version, which would eventually be known as Unix.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
In August 1969, while his wife and young son were away on vacation in
California, Thompson put together the basic components of the new system,
allocating &quot;a week each to the operating system, the shell, the editor, and the
assembler.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor would be called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;. It was based on QED but was not an exact
re-implementation. Thompson decided to ditch certain QED features. Regular
expression support was pared back so that only relatively simple regular
expressions would be understood. QED allowed users to edit several files at
once by opening multiple buffers, but &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; would only work with one buffer at a
time. And whereas QED could execute a buffer containing commands, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; would do
no such thing. These simplifications may have been called for. Dennis Ritchie
has said that going without QED&apos;s advanced regular expressions was &quot;not much
of a loss.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; is now a part of the POSIX specification, so if you have a POSIX-compliant
system, you will have it installed on your computer. It&apos;s worth playing around
with, because many of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; commands are today a part of Vim. In order to
write a buffer to disk, for example, you have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; command. In order
to quit the editor, you have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; command. These two commands can be
specified on the same line at once—hence, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wq&lt;/code&gt;. Like Vim, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; is a modal
editor; to enter input mode from command mode you would use the insert command
(&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;), the append command (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;), or the change command (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;), depending on how
you are trying to transform your text. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; also introduced the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;s/foo/bar/g&lt;/code&gt;
syntax for finding and replacing, or &quot;substituting,&quot; text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all these similarities, you might expect the average Vim user to have no
trouble using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;. But &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; is not at all like Vim in another important
respect. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; is a true line editor. It was written and widely used in the days
of the teletype printer. When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were hacking away
at Unix, they looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Ken_Thompson_%28sitting%29_and_Dennis_Ritchie_at_PDP-11_%282876612463%29.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ken Thompson interacting with a PDP-11 via
teletype.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; doesn&apos;t allow you to edit lines in place among the other lines of the open
buffer, or move a cursor around, because &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; would have to reprint the entire
file every time you made a change to it. There was no mechanism in 1969 for
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; to &quot;clear&quot; the contents of the screen, because the screen was just a sheet
of paper and everything that had already been output had been output in ink.
When necessary, you can ask &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; to print out a range of lines for you using
the list command (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;), but most of the time you are operating on text that you
can&apos;t see. Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; is thus a little trying to find your way around a dark
house with an underpowered flashlight. You can only see so much at once, so you
have to try your best to remember where everything is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s an example of an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; session. I&apos;ve added comments (after the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;
character) explaining the purpose of each line, though if these were actually
entered &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; wouldn&apos;t recognize them as comments and would complain:&lt;/p&gt;

Hello world!
Isn&amp;#39;t it a terrible day?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; is not an especially talkative program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bill Joy Writes a Text Editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; worked well enough for Thompson and Ritchie. Others found it difficult to
use and it acquired a reputation for being a particularly egregious example of
Unix&apos;s hostility toward the novice.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1975, a man named George Coulouris
developed an improved version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; on the Unix system installed at Queen
Mary&apos;s College, London. Coulouris wrote his editor to take advantage of the
video displays that he had available at Queen Mary&apos;s. Unlike &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;, Coulouris&apos;
program allowed users to edit a single line in place on screen, navigating
through the line keystroke by keystroke (imagine using Vim on one line at a
time). Coulouris called his program &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, or &quot;editor for mortals,&quot; which he had
supposedly been inspired to do after Thompson paid a visit to Queen Mary&apos;s, saw
the program Coulouris had built, and dismissed it, saying that he had no need
to see the state of a file while editing it.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976, Coulouris brought &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; with him to UC Berkeley, where he spent the
summer as a visitor to the CS department. This was exactly ten years after Ken
Thompson had left Berkeley to work at Bell Labs. At Berkeley, Coulouris met
Bill Joy, a graduate student working on the Berkeley Software Distribution
(BSD). Coulouris showed &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; to Joy, who, starting with Coulouris&apos; source code,
built out an improved version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt;, for &quot;extended &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;.&quot; Version
1.1 of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt; was bundled with the first release of BSD Unix in 1978. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt; was
largely compatible with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;, but it added two more modes: an &quot;open&quot; mode,
which enabled single-line editing like had been possible with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, and a
&quot;visual&quot; mode, which took over the whole screen and enabled live editing of an
entire file like we are used to today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second release of BSD in 1979, an executable named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; was introduced
that did little more than open &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt; in visual mode.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; (henceforth &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;) established most of the conventions we now
associate with Vim that weren&apos;t already a part of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;. The video terminal that
Joy was using was a Lear Siegler ADM-3A, which had a keyboard with no cursor
keys. Instead, arrows were painted on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; keys, which is
why Joy used those keys for cursor movement in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;. The escape key on the
ADM-3A keyboard was also where today we would find the tab key, which explains
how such a hard-to-reach key was ever assigned an operation as common as
exiting a mode. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; character that prefixes commands also comes from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;,
which in regular mode (i.e. the mode entered by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt;) used &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; as a
prompt. This addressed a long-standing complaint about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;, which, once
launched, greets users with utter silence. In visual mode, saving and quitting
now involved typing the classic &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt;. &quot;Yanking&quot; and &quot;putting,&quot; marks, and the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; command for setting options were all part of the original &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;. The
features we use in the course of basic text editing today in Vim are largely
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vintagecomputer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/LSI-ADM3A-full-keyboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Lear Siegler ADM-3A
keyboard.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; was the only text editor bundled with BSD Unix other than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;. At the
time, Emacs could cost hundreds of dollars (this was before GNU Emacs), so &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;
became enormously popular. But &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; was a direct descendant of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt;, which
meant that the source code could not be modified without an AT&amp;#x26;T source
license. This motivated several people to create open-source versions of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;.
STEVIE (ST Editor for VI Enthusiasts) appeared in 1987, Elvis appeared in 1990,
and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nvi&lt;/code&gt; appeared in 1994. Some of these clones added extra features like
syntax highlighting and split windows. Elvis in particular saw many of its
features incorporated into Vim, since so many Elvis users pushed for their
inclusion.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bram Moolenaar Writes Vim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Vim&quot;, which now abbreviates &quot;Vi Improved&quot;, originally stood for &quot;Vi
Imitation.&quot; Like many of the other &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; clones, Vim began as an attempt to
replicate &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; on a platform where it was not available. Bram Moolenaar, a
Dutch software engineer working for a photocopier company in Venlo, the
Netherlands, wanted something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; for his brand-new Amiga 2000. Moolenaar
had grown used to using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; on the Unix systems at his university and it was
now &quot;in his fingers.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So in 1988, using the existing STEVIE &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; clone as
a starting point, Moolenaar began work on Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moolenaar had access to STEVIE because STEVIE had previously appeared on
something called a Fred Fish disk. Fred Fish was an American programmer that
mailed out a floppy disk every month with a curated selection of the best
open-source software available for the Amiga platform. Anyone could request a
disk for nothing more than the price of postage. Several versions of STEVIE
were released on Fred Fish disks. The version that Moolenaar used had been
released on Fred Fish disk 256.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-11&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Disappointingly, Fred Fish disks seem to
have nothing to do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddi_Fish&quot;&gt;Freddi
Fish&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moolenaar liked STEVIE but quickly noticed that there were many &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; commands
missing.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-12&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So, for the first release of Vim, Moolenaar made &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;
compatibility his priority. Someone else had written a series of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; macros
that, when run through a properly &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;-compatible editor, could solve a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isaacs/.vim/tree/master/macros/maze&quot;&gt;randomly generated
maze&lt;/a&gt;. Moolenaar was
able to get these macros working in Vim. In 1991, Vim was released for the
first time on Fred Fish disk 591 as &quot;Vi Imitation.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-13&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Moolenaar had added
some features (including multi-level undo and a &quot;quickfix&quot; mode for compiler
errors) that meant that Vim had surpassed &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;. But Vim would remain &quot;Vi
Imitation&quot; until Vim 2.0, released in 1993 via FTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moolenaar, with the occasional help of various internet collaborators, added
features to Vim at a steady clip. Vim 2.0 introduced support for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wrap&lt;/code&gt;
option and for horizontal scrolling through long lines of text. Vim 3.0 added
support for split windows and buffers, a feature inspired by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; clone
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nvi&lt;/code&gt;. Vim also now saved each buffer to a swap file, so that edited text could
survive a crash. Vimscript made its first appearance in Vim 5.0, along with
support for syntax highlighting. All the while, Vim&apos;s popularity was growing.
It was ported to MS-DOS, to Windows, to Mac, and even to Unix, where it
competed with the original &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Vim was voted the most popular editor among &lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt;
readers.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-14&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Today, according to Stack Overflow&apos;s 2018 Developer Survey, Vim
is the most popular text-mode (i.e. terminal emulator) editor, used by 25.8% of
all software developers (and 40% of Sysadmin/DevOps people).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-15&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For a while,
during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, programmers waged the &quot;Editor
Wars,&quot; which pitted Emacs users against &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; (and eventually Vim) users. While
Emacs certainly still has a following, some people think that the Editor Wars
are over and that Vim won.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-16&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The 2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey
suggests that this is true; only 4.1% of respondents used Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Vim become so successful? Obviously people like the features that Vim
has to offer. But I would argue that the long history behind Vim illustrates
that it had more advantages than just its feature set. Vim&apos;s codebase dates
back only to 1988, when Moolenaar began working on it. The &quot;wq text editor,&quot; on
the other hand—the broader vision of how a Unix-y text editor should work—goes
back a half-century. The &quot;wq text editor&quot; had a few different concrete
expressions, but thanks in part to the unusual attention paid to backward
compatibility by both Bill Joy and Bram Moolenaar, good ideas accumulated
gradually over time. The &quot;wq text editor,&quot; in that sense, is one of the
longest-running and most successful open-source projects, having enjoyed
contributions from some of the greatest minds in the computing world. I don&apos;t
think the &quot;startup-company-throws-away
all-precedents-and-creates-disruptive-new-software&quot; approach to development is
necessarily bad, but Vim is a reminder that the collaborative and incremental
approach can also yield wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

The magazine&apos;s
editor, Arthur Salsberg, felt compelled to point out as much in the editorial
section of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Poptronics/70s/1974/Poptronics-1974-12.pdf&quot;&gt;December 1974
issue&lt;/a&gt;.
The magazine had received letters complaining that a recent article, titled
&quot;How to Set Up a Home TV Service Shop,&quot; would inspire a horde of amateur TV
technicians to go out and undercut professional repairmen, doing great damage
to everyone&apos;s TVs in the process. Salsberg thought this concern was based on a
misunderstanding about who read &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt;. He explained that,
according to the magazine&apos;s own surveys, 52% of &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt;
subscribers were electronics professionals of some kind and 150,000 of them had
repaired a TV in the last 60 days. Moreover, the average &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt;
subscriber had spent &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;470&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;l&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;q&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;u&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;m&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;470 on electronics equipment (&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.01968em;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.02778em;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03588em;&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mopen&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;3578 in 2018) and
possessed such necessities as VOMs, VTVMs, tube testers, transistor testers,
r-f signal generators, and scopes. &quot;&lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; readers are not
largely neophytes,&quot; Salsberg concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am surprised that anyone familiar with &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; could ever have
doubted its subscribers. I certainly haven&apos;t repaired a TV in the last 60 days.
My computer is a block of aluminum that I have never seen the inside of. Yet
the December 1974 issue of &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; features articles such as
&quot;Standing Wave Ratio: What It Is and How to Deal with It&quot; and &quot;Test Scene: Uses
for Your Multimeter.&quot; Even the ads are intimidating. One of them, which seems
to be for some kind of stereo system, boldly proclaims that &quot;no piece of audio
equipment is as eagerly awaited as the &apos;one four-channel unit that does
everything—i.e. the receiver with built-in circuitry for SQ, RM and CD-4 record
decoding.&apos;&quot; The mere hobbyists subscribed to &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt;, let alone
the professionals, must have been very knowledgeable indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; readers were introduced to something in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Poptronics/70s/1975/Poptronics-1975-01.pdf&quot;&gt;January
1975
issue&lt;/a&gt;
that they had never encountered before. Below a heading that read &quot;PROJECT
BREAKTHROUGH,&quot; the magazine&apos;s cover showed a large gray and black box whose
front panel bore a complicated array of lights and toggles. This was the Altair
8800, the &quot;world&apos;s first minicomputer kit to rival commercial models,&quot;
available for under $400. Though advertised as a &quot;minicomputer,&quot; the Altair
would actually be the first commercially successful member of a new class of
computers, first known as &quot;microcomputers&quot; and then eventually as PCs. The
Altair was small enough and cheap enough that the average family could have one
at home. Its appearance in &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; magazine meant that, as
Salsberg wrote in that issue, &quot;the home computer age is here—finally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/jan1975-altair.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;January 1975 cover of Popular Electronics&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written briefly about &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/simulating-the-altair&quot;&gt;the Altair before&lt;/a&gt;,
but I think the Altair is worth
revisiting. It was not an especially powerful computer compared to others
available at the time (though it cost significantly less money). Nor was it
the first general-purpose computer to incorporate a microprocessor chip—at
least three microprocessor-based computers preceded it. But the Altair was and
is a kind of Ur-Computer for all of us. It was the first popular computer in a
lineage that includes our own devices, whereas the mainframes and bulky
minicomputers that predated the Altair were an entirely different kind of
machine, programmed by punched card or else rarely interacted with directly.
The Altair was also a radically simple computer, without any kind of operating
system or even a bootloader. Unless you bought peripherals for it, the Altair
was practically a bank of RAM with switches and lights on the front. The
Altair&apos;s simplicity makes learning about it a great way to reacquaint yourself
with the basic concepts of computing, exactly as they were encountered by the
denizens of the old analog world as they first ventured into our digital one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roberts and Co.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Altair was designed and manufactured by a company called Micro
Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), based in Albuquerque, New
Mexico. MITS was run by a man named H. Edward Roberts. The company had started
off making telemetry systems for model rocket kits before moving into the
calculator market, which in the early 1970s was booming. Integrated circuits
were bringing the cost of a calculator down dramatically and suddenly every
working American professional had to have one. But the calculator market was
ruthlessly competitive and, by the beginning of 1974, MITS was deeply in debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 1974 would prove to be an &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; in computing.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In
January, Hewlett-Packard introduced the HP-65, the world&apos;s first programmable
handheld calculator. In April, Intel released the Intel 8080, its second 8-bit
microprocessor and the first microprocessor to become widely popular. Then, in
July, &lt;em&gt;Radio Electronics&lt;/em&gt; magazine advertised a build-it-yourself minicomputer
called the Mark-8, which employed the Intel 8008 microprocessor that Intel had
released in 1972. The Mark-8 was only the third computer ever built using a
microprocessor and it was the first to be appear on the cover of a
magazine.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Mark-8&apos;s appearance in &lt;em&gt;Radio Electronics&lt;/em&gt; pushed &lt;em&gt;Popular
Electronics&lt;/em&gt; to look for a minicomputer project of their own to feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; subscribers actually received their copies of the January
1975 issue in the mail in December of 1974.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So the announcement of the
Altair closed out the &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; that was that year. The Altair&apos;s
introduction was so momentous because never before had such a fully capable
computer been offered to the public at an affordable price. The PDP-8, one the
most popular minicomputers at the time, could only be bought for several
thousand dollars. Yet the Intel 8080 chip at the heart of the Altair made it
almost as capable as the PDP-8, if not more so; the 8080 supported a wider
instruction set and the Altair could be expanded to have up to 64kb of memory,
while the stock PDP-8 typically only had 4kb. The Altair was also more powerful
than the Mark-8, which, because it was based on the Intel 8008, could only
address 16kb of memory. And whereas the Mark-8 had to be built from scratch by
customers with only a booklet and printed circuit boards to guide them, the
Altair could be purchased fully assembled, though MITS soon became so inundated
with orders that the only real way to get an Altair was to order the
construction kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; readers, the Altair was their first window into
the world of digital computing. The article introducing the Altair in the
January 1975 issue was written by Roberts and the Altair&apos;s co-designer, William
Yates. Roberts and Yates took pains to explain, in terms familiar to the
electricians and radio enthusiasts in their audience, the basic concepts
underlying digital hardware and computer programming. &quot;A computer,&quot; they wrote,
&quot;is basically a piece of variable hardware. By changing the bit pattern stored
in the memory, the hardware can be altered from one type of device to another.&quot;
Of programming, meanwhile, Roberts and Yates wrote that the basic concepts are
&quot;simple enough to master in a relatively short time,&quot; but that becoming &quot;an
efficient programmer requires a lot of experience and a large amount of
creativity,&quot; which sounds about right to me. The article included a detailed
diagram explaining all the constituent circuits of the Intel 8080 CPU, even
though readers would receive at least that part fully assembled. It explained
the difference between a CPU and a computer&apos;s memory unit, the uses of a stack
pointer, and the enormous advantages offered by assembly languages and
higher-level languages like FORTRAN and BASIC over manual entry of machine
code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; had in fact been running a series written by Roberts for
several issues before January 1975. The series was billed as a short course in
&quot;digital logic.&quot; In the December 1974 issue, Roberts walked readers through
building a &quot;very low cost computer terminal,&quot; which was basically an octal
keypad that could input values into an 8-bit computer. In the course of
describing the keypad, Roberts explained how transistor-to-transistor logic
works and also how to construct a flip-flop, a kind of circuit capable of
&quot;remembering&quot; digital values. The keypad, Roberts promised, could be used with
the Altair computer, to be announced the following month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s unclear how many &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; readers actually built the keypad,
but it would have been a very useful thing to have. Without a keypad or
some other input mechanism, the only way to input values into the Altair was
through the switches on the front panel. The front panel had a row of 16
switches that could be used to set an address and a lower row of eight switches
that could be used to control the operation of the computer. The eight
right-most switches in the row of 16 could also be used to specify a value to
be stored in memory. This made sense because the Intel 8080 used 16-bit values
to address 8-bit words. The 16 switches on the front panel each represented a
bit—the up position represented a one, while the down position represented a
zero. Interacting with a computer this way is a revelation (more on that in a
minute), because the Altair&apos;s front panel is a true binary interface. It&apos;s as
close as you can get to the bare metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As alien as the Altair&apos;s interface is to us today, it was not unusual for its
time. The PDP-8, for example, had a similar binary input mechanism on its front
panel, though the PDP-8&apos;s switches were nicer and colored in that attractive
orange and yellow color scheme that really ought to make a comeback. The PDP-8,
however, was often paired with a paper-tape reader or a teletype machine, which
made program entry much easier. These I/O devices were expensive, meaning that
most Altair users in the early days were stuck with the front panel. As you
might imagine, entering long programs via the switches was a chore. Eventually
the Altair could be hooked up to a cassette recorder and programs could be
loaded that way. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, in what would become Microsoft&apos;s
first ever commercial venture, also wrote a version of BASIC for the Altair
that MITS licensed and released in the middle of 1975. Users that could afford
a teletype could then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv5b1Xowxdk&quot;&gt;load BASIC into the Altair via paper
tape&lt;/a&gt; and interact with their
Altair through text. BASIC, which had become everyone&apos;s favorite introductory
programming language in schools, would go on to become the standard interface
to the machines produced in the early microcomputer era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;z80pack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the efforts of several internet people, in particular a person named
Udo Munk, you can run a simulation of the Altair on your computer. The
simulation is built on top of some software that emulates the Zilog Z80 CPU, a
CPU designed to be software-compatible with the Intel 8080. The Altair
simulation allows you to input programs entirely via the front panel switches
like early users of the Altair had to do. Though clicking on switches does not
offer the same tactile satisfaction as flipping real switches, playing with the
Altair simulation is a great way to appreciate how a binary human/computer
interface was both horribly inefficient and, at least in my opinion, charmingly
straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;z80pack, Udo Munk&apos;s Z80 emulation package, can be downloaded from the z80pack
website. There are instructions in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/simulating-the-altair&quot;&gt;my last Altair post&lt;/a&gt;
explaining how to get it set up
on Mac OS. If you are able to compile both the FrontPanel library and the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;altairsim&lt;/code&gt; executable, you should be able to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;altairsim&lt;/code&gt; and see the
following window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/altair.png&quot; alt=&quot;Simulated Altair Front
Panel&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, at least with the version of z80pack that I am using (1.36), the
Altair is configured with something called Tarbell boot ROM, which I think is
used to load disk images. In practice, what this means is that you can&apos;t write
values into the first several words in RAM. If you edit the file
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/altairsim/conf/system.conf&lt;/code&gt;, you can instead set up a simple Altair that has
16 pages of RAM and no ROM or bootloader software at all. You can also use this
configuration file to increase the size of the window the simulation runs in,
which is handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front panel of the Altair is intimidating, but in reality there isn&apos;t that
much going on. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/altair/d/88opman.pdf&quot;&gt;Altair
manual&lt;/a&gt; does a good
job of explaining the many switches and status lights, as does this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suyiMfzmZKs&quot;&gt;YouTube
video&lt;/a&gt;. To enter and run a simple
program, you only really need to know a few things. The lights labeled D0
through D7 near the top right of the Altair indicate the contents of the
currently addressed word. The lights labeled A0 through A15 indicate the
current address. The 16 switches below the address lights can be used to set a
new address; when the &quot;EXAMINE&quot; switch is pressed upward, the data lights
update to show the contents of the newly addressed word. In this way, you can
&quot;peek&quot; at all the words in memory. You can also press the &quot;EXAMINE&quot; switch down
to the &quot;EXAMINE NEXT&quot; position, which automatically examines the next memory
address, which makes peeking at sequential words significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save a bit pattern to a word, you have to set the bit pattern using the
right-most eight switches labeled 0 through 7. You then press the &quot;DEPOSIT&quot;
switch upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Poptronics/70s/1975/Poptronics-1975-02.pdf&quot;&gt;February 1975
issue&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt;, Roberts and Yates walked Altair owners through
inputting a small sample program to ensure that their Altair was functioning.
The program loads two integers from memory, adds them, and saves the sum back
into memory. The program consists of only six instructions, but those six
instructions involve 14 words of memory altogether, which takes some time to
input correctly. The sample program also appears in the Altair manual in table
form, which I&apos;ve reproduced here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div markdown=&quot;block&quot; class=&quot;table-container&quot;&gt;
| Address | Mnemonic | Bit Pattern | Octal Equivalent |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 0       | LDA      | 00 111 010  | 0 7 2            |
| 1       | (address)| 10 000 000  | 2 0 0            |
| 2       | (address)| 00 000 000  | 0 0 0            |
| 3       | MOV B, A | 01 000 111  | 1 0 7            |
| 4       | LDA      | 00 111 010  | 0 7 2            |
| 5       | (address)| 10 000 001  | 2 0 1            |
| 6       | (address)| 00 000 000  | 0 0 0            |
| 7       | ADD B    | 10 000 000  | 2 0 0            |
| 8       | STA      | 00 110 010  | 0 6 2            |
| 9       | (address)| 10 000 010  | 2 0 2            |
| 10      | (address)| 00 000 000  | 0 0 0            |
| 11      | JMP      | 11 000 011  | 3 0 3            |
| 12      | (address)| 00 000 000  | 0 0 0            |
| 13      | (address)| 00 000 000  | 0 0 0            |
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you input each word in the above table into the Altair via the switches, you
end up with a program that loads the value in word 128, adds it to the value in
the word 129, and finally saves it into word 130. The addresses that accompany
each instruction taking an address are given with the least-significant bits
first, which is why the second byte is always zeroed out (no addresses are
higher than 255). Once you&apos;ve input the program and entered some values into
words 128 and 129, you can press the &quot;RUN&quot; switch into the down position
briefly before pushing it into the &quot;STOP&quot; position. Since the program loops,
it repeatedly adds those values and saves the sum thousands of times a second.
The sum is always the same though, so if you peek at word 130 after stopping
the program, you should find the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know whether any regular users of the Altair ever had access to an
assembler, but z80pack includes one. The z80pack assembler, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;z80asm&lt;/code&gt;, is meant
for Z80 assembly, so it uses a different set of mnemonics altogether. But since
the Z80 was designed to be compatible with software written for the Intel 8080,
the opcodes are all the same, even if the mnemonics are different. So just to
illustrate what it might have been like to write the same program in assembly,
here is a version that can be assembled by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;z80asm&lt;/code&gt; and loaded into the Altair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;        ORG  0000H
START:  LD   A,(80H)   ;Load from address 128.
        LD   B,A       ;Move loaded value from accumulator (A) to reg B.
        LD   A,(81H)   ;Load from address 129.
        ADD  A,B       ;Add A and B.
        LD   (82H),A   ;Store A at address 130.
        JP   START     ;Jump to start.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can turn this into something called an Intel HEX file by invoking the
assembler like so (after you have compiled it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ ./z80asm -fh -oadd.hex add.asm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; flag, here taking &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; as an argument, specifies that a HEX file should
be output. You can then load the program into the Altair by passing the HEX
file in using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; flag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ ./altairsim -x add.hex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sets up the first 14 words in memory as if you had input the values
manually via the switches. Instead of doing all that again, you can just run
the program by using the &quot;RUN&quot; switch as before. Much easier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I don&apos;t think many Altair users wrote software this way. Once Altair
BASIC became available, writing BASIC programs was probably the easiest way to
program the Altair. z80pack also includes several HEX files containing
different versions of Altair BASIC; the one I&apos;ve been able to get working is
version 4.0 of 4K BASIC, which you can load into the simulator like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ ./altairsim -x basic4k40.hex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you turn the simulated machine on and hit the &quot;RUN&quot; switch, you should see
that BASIC has started talking to you in your terminal window. It first prompts
you to enter the amount of memory you have available, which should be 4000
bytes. It then asks you a few more questions before presenting you with the
&quot;OK&quot; prompt, which Gates and Allen used instead of the standard &quot;READY&quot; to save
memory. From there, you can just use BASIC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;OK
PRINT 3 + 4
 7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though running BASIC with only 4kb of memory didn&apos;t give you a lot of room, you
can see how it would have been a significant step up from using the front
panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Altair, of course, was nowhere near as capable as the home desktops and
laptops we have available to us today. Even something like the Macintosh,
released less than a decade later, seems like a quantum leap forward over the
spartan Altair. But to those first &lt;em&gt;Popular Electronics&lt;/em&gt; readers that bought
the kit and assembled it, the Altair was a real, fully capable computer that
they could own for themselves, all for the low cost of $400 and half the
surface space of the credenza. This would have been an amazing thing for people
that had thus far only been able to interact with computers by handing &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/ibm-029-card-punch.md&quot;&gt;a stack
of cards&lt;/a&gt; or a roll of tape
to another human being entrusted with the actual operation of the computer.
Subsequent microcomputers would improve upon what the Altair offered and
quickly become much easier to use, but they were all, in some sense, just more
complicated Altairs. The Altair—almost Brutalist in its minimalism—was the
bare-essentials blueprint for all that would follow.&lt;/p&gt;

If your software engineering career, like mine, is
no older than Github, then Git may be the only version control software you
have ever used. While people sometimes grouse about its steep learning curve or
unintuitive interface, Git has become everyone&apos;s go-to for version control. In
Stack Overflow&apos;s 2015 developer survey, 69.3% of respondents used Git, almost
twice as many as used the second-most-popular version control system,
Subversion.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; After 2015, Stack Overflow stopped asking developers about the
version control systems they use, perhaps because Git had become so popular
that the question was uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git itself is not much older than Github. Linus Torvalds released the first
version of Git in 2005. Though today younger developers might have a hard time
conceiving of a world where the term &quot;version control software&quot; didn&apos;t more or
less just mean Git, such a world existed not so long ago. There were lots of
alternatives to choose from. Open source developers preferred Subversion,
enterprises and video game companies used Perforce (some still do), while the
Linux kernel project famously relied on a version control system called
BitKeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these systems, particularly BitKeeper, might feel familiar to a young
Git user transported back in time. Most would not. BitKeeper aside, the version
control systems that came before Git worked according to a fundamentally
different paradigm. In a taxonomy offered by Eric Sink, author of &lt;em&gt;Version
Control by Example&lt;/em&gt;, Git is a third-generation version control system, while
most of Git&apos;s predecessors, the systems popular in the 1990s and early 2000s,
are second-generation version control systems.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Where third-generation
version control systems are distributed, second-generation version control
systems are centralized. You have almost certainly heard Git described as a
&quot;distributed&quot; version control system before. I never quite understood the
distributed/centralized distinction, at least not until I installed and
experimented with a centralized second-generation version control system
myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system I installed was CVS. CVS, short for Concurrent Versions System, was
the very first second-generation version control system. It was also the most
popular version control system for about a decade until it was replaced in 2000
by Subversion. Even then, Subversion was supposed to be &quot;CVS but better,&quot; which
only underscores how dominant CVS had become throughout the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVS was first developed in 1986 by a Dutch computer scientist named Dick Grune,
who was looking for a way to collaborate with his students on a compiler
project.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; CVS was initially little more than a collection of shell scripts
wrapping RCS (Revision Control System), a first-generation version control
system that Grune wanted to improve. RCS works according to a pessimistic
locking model, meaning that no two programmers can work on a single file at
once. In order to edit a file, you have to first ask RCS for an exclusive lock
on the file, which you keep until you are finished editing. If someone else is
already editing a file you need to edit, you have to wait. CVS improved on RCS
and ushered in the second generation of version control systems by trading the
pessimistic locking model for an optimistic one. Programmers could now edit the
same file at the same time, merging their edits and resolving any conflicts
later. (Brian Berliner, an engineer who later took over the CVS project, wrote
a very readable &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/28.cvs/paper.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;
about CVS&apos; innovations in 1990.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, CVS wasn&apos;t all that different from Git, which also works
according to an optimistic model. But that&apos;s where the similarities end. In
fact, when Linus Torvalds was developing Git, one of his guiding principles was
WWCVSND, or &quot;What Would CVS Not Do.&quot; Whenever he was in doubt about a decision,
he strove to choose the option that had not been chosen in the design of
CVS.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So even though CVS predates Git by over a decade, it influenced Git as
a kind of negative template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve really enjoyed playing around with CVS. I think there&apos;s no better way to
understand why Git&apos;s distributed nature is such an improvement on what came
before. So I invite you to come along with me on an exciting journey and
spend the next ten minutes of your life learning about a piece of software
nobody has used in the last decade. (&lt;em&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;#correction&quot;&gt;correction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started with CVS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions for installing CVS can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/&quot;&gt;project&apos;s
homepage&lt;/a&gt;. On MacOS, you can install CVS using
Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since CVS is centralized, it distinguishes between the client-side universe and
the server-side universe in a way that something like Git does not. The
distinction is not so pronounced that there are different executables. But in
order to start using CVS, even on your own machine, you&apos;ll have to set up the
CVS backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CVS backend, the central store for all your code, is called the repository.
Whereas in Git you would typically have a repository for every project, in CVS
the repository holds all of your projects. There is one central repository for
everything, though there are ways to work with only a project at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a local repository, you run the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; command. You would do this
somewhere global like your home directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs -d ~/sandbox init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVS allows you to pass options to either the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs&lt;/code&gt; command itself or to the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; subcommand. Options that appear after the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs&lt;/code&gt; command are global in
nature, while options that appear after the subcommand are specific to the
subcommand. In this case, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flag is global. Here it happens to tell CVS
where we want to create our repository, but in general the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flag points to
the location of the repository we want to use for any given action. It can be
tedious to supply the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flag all the time, so the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CVSROOT&lt;/code&gt; environment
variable can be set instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we&apos;re working locally, we&apos;ve just passed a path for our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; argument,
but we could also have included a hostname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command creates a directory called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sandbox&lt;/code&gt; in your home directory. If you
list the contents of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sandbox&lt;/code&gt;, you&apos;ll find that it contains another directory
called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CVSROOT&lt;/code&gt;. This directory, not to be confused with the environment
variable, holds administrative files for the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You&apos;ve just created your first CVS repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checking In Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say that you&apos;ve decided to keep a list of your favorite colors. You are
an artistically inclined but extremely forgetful person. You type up your list
of colors and save it as a file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;blue
orange
green

definitely not yellow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s also assume that you&apos;ve saved your file in a new directory called
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt;. Now you&apos;d like to put your favorite color list under version control,
because fifty years from now it will be interesting to look back and see how
your tastes changed through time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do that, you will have to import your directory as a new CVS
project. You can do that using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs -d ~/sandbox import -m &amp;quot;&amp;quot; colors colors initial
N colors/favorites.txt

No conflicts created by this import&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are specifying the location of our repository with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flag
again. The remaining arguments are passed to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; subcommand. We have
to provide a message, but here we don&apos;t really need one, so we&apos;ve left it
blank. The next argument, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt;, specifies the name of our new directory in
the repository; here we&apos;ve just used the same name as the directory we are in.
The last two arguments specify the vendor tag and the release tag respectively.
We&apos;ll talk more about tags in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ve just pulled your &quot;colors&quot; project into the CVS repository. There are a
couple different ways to go about bringing code into CVS, but this is the
method recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780974514000.do&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pragmatic Version Control Using
CVS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Pragmatic
Programmer book about CVS. What makes this method a little awkward is that you
then have to check out your work fresh, even though you&apos;ve already got an
existing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt; directory. Instead of using that directory, you&apos;re going to
delete it and then check out the version that CVS already knows about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs -d ~/sandbox co colors
cvs checkout: Updating colors
U colors/favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create a new directory, also called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt;. In this directory you
will find your original &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt; file along with a directory called
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CVS&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CVS&lt;/code&gt; directory is basically CVS&apos; equivalent of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; directory
in every Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready for a trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Git, CVS has a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;status&lt;/code&gt; subcommand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs status
cvs status: Examining .
===================================================================
File: favorites.txt    	Status: Up-to-date

   Working revision:	1.1.1.1	2018-07-06 19:27:54 -0400
   Repository revision:	1.1.1.1	/Users/sinclairtarget/sandbox/colors/favorites.txt,v
   Commit Identifier:	fD7GYxt035GNg8JA
   Sticky Tag:		(none)
   Sticky Date:		(none)
   Sticky Options:	(none)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things start to look alien. CVS doesn&apos;t have commit objects. In
the above, there is something called a &quot;Commit Identifier,&quot; but this might be
only a relatively recent edition—no mention of a &quot;Commit Identifier&quot; appears in
&lt;em&gt;Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS&lt;/em&gt;, which was published in 2003. (The last
update to CVS was released in 2008.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas with Git you&apos;d talk about the version of a file associated with commit
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;45de392&lt;/code&gt;, in CVS files are versioned separately. The first version of your
file is version 1.1, the next version is 1.2, and so on. When branches are
involved, extra numbers are appended, so you might end up with something like
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/code&gt; above, which appears to be the default in our case even though we
haven&apos;t created any branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs log&lt;/code&gt; (equivalent to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt;) in a project with lots
of files and commits, you&apos;d see an individual history for each file. You might
have a file at version 1.2 and a file at version 1.14 in the same project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s go ahead and make a change to version 1.1 of our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt; blue
 orange
 green
+cyan

 definitely not yellow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we&apos;ve made the change, we can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs diff&lt;/code&gt; to see what CVS thinks we&apos;ve
done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs diff
cvs diff: Diffing .
Index: favorites.txt
===================================================================
RCS file: /Users/sinclairtarget/sandbox/colors/favorites.txt,v
retrieving revision 1.1.1.1
diff -r1.1.1.1 favorites.txt
3a4
&amp;gt; cyan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVS recognizes that we added a new line containing the color &quot;cyan&quot; to the
file. (Actually, it says we&apos;ve made changes to the &quot;RCS&quot; file; you can see that
CVS never fully escaped its original association with RCS.) The diff we are
being shown is the diff between the copy of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt; in our working
directory and the 1.1.1.1 version stored in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to update the version stored in the repository, we have to commit the
change. In Git, this would be a multi-step process. We&apos;d have to stage the
change so that it appears in our index. Then we&apos;d commit the change. Finally,
to make the change visible to anyone else, we&apos;d have to push the commit up to
the origin repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CVS, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these things happen when you run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs commit&lt;/code&gt;. CVS just
bundles up all the changes it can find and puts them in the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs commit -m &amp;quot;Add cyan to favorites.&amp;quot;
cvs commit: Examining .
/Users/sinclairtarget/sandbox/colors/favorites.txt,v  &amp;lt;--  favorites.txt
new revision: 1.2; previous revision: 1.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m so used to Git that this strikes me as terrifying. Without an opportunity
to stage changes, any old thing that you&apos;ve touched in your working directory
might end up as part of the public repository. Did you passive-aggressively
rewrite a coworker&apos;s poorly implemented function out of cathartic necessity,
never intending for him to know? Too bad, he now thinks you&apos;re a dick. You also
can&apos;t edit your commits before pushing them, since a commit &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a push. Do you
enjoy spending 40 minutes repeatedly running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git rebase -i&lt;/code&gt; until your local
commit history flows like the derivation of a mathematical proof? Sorry, you
can&apos;t do that here, and everyone is going to find out that you don&apos;t actually
write your tests first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also now understand why so many people find Git needlessly complicated.
If &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs commit&lt;/code&gt; is what you were used to, then I&apos;m sure staging and pushing
changes would strike you as a pointless chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about Git being a &quot;distributed&quot; system, this is primarily the
difference they mean. In CVS, you can&apos;t make commits locally. A commit is a
submission of code to the central repository, so it&apos;s not something you can do
without a connection. All you&apos;ve got locally is your working directory. In Git,
you have a full-fledged local repository, so you can make commits all day long
even while disconnected. And you can edit those commits, revert, branch, and
cherry pick as much as you want, without anybody else having to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since commits were a bigger deal, CVS users often made them infrequently.
Commits would contain as many changes as today we might expect to see in a
ten-commit pull request. This was especially true if commits triggered a CI
build and an automated test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we now run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs status&lt;/code&gt;, we can see that we have a new version of our file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs status
cvs status: Examining .
===================================================================
File: favorites.txt    	Status: Up-to-date

   Working revision:	1.2	2018-07-06 21:18:59 -0400
   Repository revision:	1.2	/Users/sinclairtarget/sandbox/colors/favorites.txt,v
   Commit Identifier:	pQx5ooyNk90wW8JA
   Sticky Tag:		(none)
   Sticky Date:		(none)
   Sticky Options:	(none)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, in CVS you can edit a file that someone else is already
editing. That was CVS&apos; big improvement on RCS. What happens when you need to
bring your changes back together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say that you have invited some friends to add their favorite colors to
your list. While they are adding their colors, you decide that you no longer
like the color green and remove it from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to commit your changes, you might discover that CVS notices a
problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs commit -m &amp;quot;Remove green&amp;quot;
cvs commit: Examining .
cvs commit: Up-to-date check failed for `favorites.txt&amp;#39;
cvs [commit aborted]: correct above errors first!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like your friends committed their changes first. So your version of
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt; is not up-to-date with the version in the repository. If you
run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs status&lt;/code&gt;, you&apos;ll see that your local copy of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt; is version
1.2 with some local changes, but the repository version is 1.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs status
cvs status: Examining .
===================================================================
File: favorites.txt    	Status: Needs Merge

   Working revision:	1.2	2018-07-07 10:42:43 -0400
   Repository revision:	1.3	/Users/sinclairtarget/sandbox/colors/favorites.txt,v
   Commit Identifier:	2oZ6n0G13bDaldJA
   Sticky Tag:		(none)
   Sticky Date:		(none)
   Sticky Options:	(none)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs diff&lt;/code&gt; to see exactly what the differences between 1.2 and
1.3 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs diff -r HEAD favorites.txt
Index: favorites.txt
===================================================================
RCS file: /Users/sinclairtarget/sandbox/colors/favorites.txt,v

&amp;lt;
&amp;lt; pink
&amp;lt; hot pink
&amp;lt; bubblegum pink&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that our friends really like pink. In any case, they&apos;ve edited a
different part of the file than we have, so the changes are easy to merge. CVS
can do that for us when we run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs update&lt;/code&gt;, which is similar to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs update
cvs update: Updating .
RCS file: /Users/sinclairtarget/sandbox/colors/favorites.txt,v
retrieving revision 1.2
retrieving revision 1.3
Merging differences between 1.2 and 1.3 into favorites.txt
M favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you now take a look at &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt;, you&apos;ll find that it has been
modified to include the changes that your friends made to the file. Your
changes are still there too. Now you are free to commit the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs commit
cvs commit: Examining .
/Users/sinclairtarget/sandbox/colors/favorites.txt,v  &amp;lt;--  favorites.txt
new revision: 1.4; previous revision: 1.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is what you&apos;d get in Git by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git pull --rebase&lt;/code&gt;. Your
changes have been added on top of your friends&apos; changes. There is no &quot;merge
commit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, changes to the same file might be incompatible. If your friends had
changed &quot;green&quot; to &quot;olive,&quot; for example, that would have conflicted with your
change removing &quot;green&quot; altogether. In the early days of CVS, this was exactly
the kind of case that caused people to worry that CVS wasn&apos;t safe; RCS&apos;
pessimistic locking ensured that such a case could never arise. But CVS
guarantees safety by making sure that nobody&apos;s changes get overwritten
automatically. You have to tell CVS which change you want to keep going
forward, so when you run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs update&lt;/code&gt;, CVS marks up the file with both changes
in the same way that Git does when Git detects a merge conflict. You then have
to manually edit the file and pick the change you want to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing to note here is that merge conflicts have to be fixed
before you can commit. This is another consequence of CVS&apos; centralized nature.
In Git, you don&apos;t have to worry about resolving merges until you push the
commits you&apos;ve got locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tags and Branches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since CVS doesn&apos;t have easily addressable commit objects, the only way to group
a collection of changes is to mark a particular working directory state with a
tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a tag is easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs tag VERSION_1_0
cvs tag: Tagging .
T favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll later be able to return files to this state by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs update&lt;/code&gt; and
passing the tag to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; flag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs update -r VERSION_1_0
cvs update: Updating .
U favorites.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you need a tag to rewind to an earlier working directory state, CVS
encourages a lot of preemptive tagging. Before major refactors, for example,
you might create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;BEFORE_REFACTOR_01&lt;/code&gt; tag that you could later use if the
refactor went wrong. People also used tags if they wanted to generate
project-wide diffs. Basically, all the things we routinely do today with commit
hashes have to be anticipated and planned for with CVS, since you needed to
have the tags available already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branches can be created in CVS, sort of. Branches are just a special kind of
tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs rtag -b TRY_EXPERIMENTAL_THING colors
cvs rtag: Tagging colors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That only creates the branch (in full view of everyone, by the way), so you
still need to switch to it using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs update&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs update -r TRY_EXPERIMENTAL_THING&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above commands switch onto the new branch in your current working
directory, but &lt;em&gt;Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS&lt;/em&gt; actually advises that you
create a new directory to hold your new branch. Presumably its authors found
switching directories easier than switching branches in CVS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS&lt;/em&gt; also advises against creating branches
off of an existing branch. They recommend only creating branches off of the
mainline branch, which in Git is known as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;. In general, branching was
considered an &quot;advanced&quot; CVS skill. In Git, you might start a new branch for
almost any trivial reason, but in CVS branching was typically used only when
really necessary, such as for releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A branch could later be merged back into the mainline using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cvs update&lt;/code&gt; and
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-j&lt;/code&gt; flag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cvs update -j TRY_EXPERIMENTAL_THING&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks for the Commit Histories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Linus Torvalds gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8&quot;&gt;a
talk&lt;/a&gt; about Git at Google. Git was
very new then, so the talk was basically an attempt to persuade a roomful of
skeptical programmers that they should use Git, even though Git was so
different from anything then available. If you haven&apos;t already seen the talk, I
highly encourage you to watch it. Linus is an entertaining speaker, even if he
never fails to be his brash self. He does an excellent job of explaining why
the distributed model of version control is better than the centralized one. A
lot of his criticism is reserved for CVS in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1597/&quot;&gt;complex tool&lt;/a&gt;. Learning it can be a
frustrating experience. But I&apos;m also continually amazed at the things that Git
can do. In comparison, CVS is simple and straightforward, though often unable
to do many of the operations we now take for granted. Going back and using CVS
for a while is an excellent way to find yourself with a new appreciation for
Git&apos;s power and flexibility. It illustrates well why understanding the history
of software development can be so beneficial—picking up and re-examining
obsolete tools will teach you volumes about the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; behind the tools we use
today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Correction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been told that there are many organizations, particularly risk-adverse
organizations that do things like make medical device software, that still use
CVS. Programmers in these organizations have developed little tricks for
working around CVS&apos; limitations, such as making a new branch for almost every
change to avoid committing directly to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt;. (Thanks to Michael Kohne for
pointing this out.)&lt;/p&gt;

I appreciate that this
is pedantic. I&apos;ve seen people on the internet make good arguments for why the
80-character limit ought to be respected even on our modern Retina-display
screens, but those arguments hardly justify the visceral hatred I feel for even
that one protruding 81st character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was once a golden era in which it was basically impossible to go over the
80-character limit. The 80-character limit was a physical reality, because
there was no 81st column for an 81st character to fit in. Any programmers
attempting to name a function something horrendously long and awful would
discover, in a moment of delicious, slow-dawning horror, that there literally
isn&apos;t room for their whole declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This golden era was the era of punch card programming. By the 1960s, IBM&apos;s
punch cards had set the standard and the standard was that punch cards had 80
columns. The 80-column standard survived into the teletype and dumb terminal
era and from there embedded itself into the nooks and crannies of our operating
systems. Today, when you launch your terminal emulator and open a new window,
odds are it will be 80 characters wide, even though we now have plenty of
screen real estate and tend to favor longer identifiers over inscrutable
nonsense like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;iswcntrl()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If questions on Quora are any indication, many people have trouble imagining
what it must have been like to program computers using punch cards. I will
admit that for a long time I also didn&apos;t understand how punch card programming
could have worked, because it struck me as awfully labor-intensive to punch all
those holes. This was a misunderstanding; programmers never punched holes in
cards the same way a train conductor does. They had card punch machines (also
known as key punches), which allowed them to punch holes in cards using a
typewriter-style keyboard. And card punches were hardly new technology—they
were around as early as the 1890s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most widely used card punch machines was the IBM 029. It is perhaps
the best remembered card punch today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/ibm029_front.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IBM 029 was released in 1964 as part of IBM&apos;s System/360 rollout.
System/360 was a family of computing systems and peripherals that would go on
to dominate the mainframe computing market in the late 1960s. Like many of the
other System/360 machines, the 029 was big. This was an era when the
distinction between computing machinery and furniture was blurry—the 029 was
not something you put on a table but an entire table in itself. The 029
improved upon its predecessor, the 026, by supporting new characters like
parentheses and by generally being quieter. It had cool electric blue
highlights and was flat and angular whereas the 026 had a 1940s rounded,
industrial look. Another of its big selling points was that it could
automatically left-pad numeric fields with zeros, demonstrating that JavaScript
programmers were not the first programmers too lazy to do their own
left-padding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, you might say—IBM released a brand-new card punch in 1964? What about
that photograph of the Unix gods at Bell Labs using teletype machines in, like,
1970? Weren&apos;t card punching machines passé by the mid- to late-1960s? Well, it
might surprise you to know that the 029 was available in IBM&apos;s catalog until as
late as 1984.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, most programmers programmed using punch cards until
well into the 1970s. This doesn&apos;t make much sense given that there were people
using teletype machines during World War II. Indeed, the teletype is almost of
the same vintage as the card punch. The limiting factor, it turns out, was not
the availability of teletypes but the availability of computing time. What kept
people from using teletypes was that teletypes assumed an interactive, &quot;online&quot;
model of communication with the computer. Before Unix and the invention of
timesharing operating systems, your interactive session with a computer would
have stopped everyone else from using it, a delay potentially costing thousands
of dollars. So programmers instead wrote their programs offline using card
punch machines and then fed them into mainframe computers later as batch jobs.
Punch cards had the added benefit of being a cheap data store in an era where
cheap, reliable data storage was hard to come by. Your programs lived in stacks
of cards on your shelves rather than in files on your hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was it actually like using an IBM 029 card punch? That&apos;s hard to
explain without first taking a look at the cards themselves. A typical punch
card had 12 rows and 80 columns. The bottom nine rows were the digit rows,
numbered one through nine. These rows had the appropriate digit printed in each
column. The top three rows, called the &quot;zone&quot; rows, consisted of two blank rows
and usually a zero row. Row 12 was at the very top of the card, followed by row
11, then rows zero through nine. This somewhat confusing ordering meant that
the top edge of the card was called the 12 edge while the bottom was called the
nine edge. A corner of each card was usually clipped to make it easier to keep
a stack of cards all turned around the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/card.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they were first invented, punch cards were meant to be punched with
circular holes, but IBM eventually realized that they could fit more columns on
a card if the holes were narrow rectangles. Different combinations of holes in
a column represented different characters. For human convenience, card punches
like the 029 would print each column&apos;s character at the top of the card at the
same time as punching the necessary holes. Digits were represented by one
punched hole in the appropriate digit row. Alphabetical and symbolic characters
were represented by a hole in a zone row and then a combination of one or two
holes in the digit rows. The letter A, for example, was represented by a hole
in the 12 zone row and another hole in the one row. This was an encoding of
sorts, sometimes called the Hollerith code, after the original inventor of the
punch card machine. The encoding allowed for only a relatively small character
set; lowercase letters, for example, were not represented. Some clever engineer
today might wonder why punch cards didn&apos;t just use a binary encoding—after all,
with 12 rows, you could encode over 4000 characters. The Hollerith code was
used instead because it ensured that no more than three holes ever appeared in
a single column. This preserved the structural integrity of the card. A binary
encoding would have entailed so many holes that the card would have fallen
apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cards came in different flavors. By the 1960s, 80 columns was the standard, but
those 80 columns could be used to represent different things. The basic punch
card was unlabeled, but cards meant for COBOL programming, for example, divided
the 80 columns into fields. On a COBOL card, the last eight columns were
reserved for an identification number, which could be used to automatically
sort a stack of cards if it were dropped (apparently a perennial hazard).
Another column, column seven, could be used to indicate that the statement on
this card was a continuation of a statement on a previous card. This meant that
if you were truly desperate you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; circumvent the 80-character limit,
though whether a two-card statement counts as one long line or just two is
unclear. FORTRAN cards were similar but had different fields.  Universities
often watermarked the punch cards handed out by their computing centers, while
other kinds of designs were introduced for special occasions like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkmscott.net/data/Punched%20card%20013.jpg&quot;&gt;1976
bicentennial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the cards had to be read and understood by a computer. IBM sold a
System/360 peripheral called the IBM 2540 which could read up to 1000 cards per
minute.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The IBM 2540 ran electrical brushes across the surface of each card
which made contact with a plate behind the cards wherever there was a hole.
Once read, the System/360 family of computers represented the characters on
each punch card using an 8-bit encoding called EBCDIC, which stood for Extended
Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code. EBCDIC was a proper binary encoding, but
it still traced its roots back to the punch card via an earlier encoding called
BCDIC, a 6-bit encoding which used the low four bits to represent a punch
card&apos;s digit rows and the high two bits to represent the zone rows. Punch card
programmers would typically hand their cards to the actual computer operators,
who would feed the cards into the IBM 2540 and then hand the printed results
back to the programmer. The programmer usually didn&apos;t see the computer at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the programmer did see a lot of was the card punch. The 029 was not a
computer, but that doesn&apos;t mean that it wasn&apos;t a complicated machine. The best
way to understand what it was like using the 029 is to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaQmAybWn-w&quot;&gt;this
instructional video&lt;/a&gt; made by the
computing center at the University of Michigan in 1967. I&apos;m going to do my best
to summarize it here, but if you don&apos;t watch the video you will miss out on all
the wonderful clacking and whooshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 029 was built around a U-shaped track that the punch cards traveled along.
On the right-hand side, at the top of the U, was the card hopper, which you
would typically load with a fresh stack of cards before using the machine. The
IBM 029 worked primarily with 80-column cards, but the card hopper could
accommodate smaller cards if needed. Your punch cards would start in the card
hopper, travel along the line of the U, and then end up in the stacker, at the
top of the U on the left-hand side. The cards would accumulate there in the
order that you punched them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To turn the machine on, you flipped a switch under the desk at about the height
of your knees. You then pressed the &quot;FEED&quot; key twice to get cards loaded into
the machine. The business part of the card track, the bottom of the U, was made
up of three separate stations: On the right was a kind of waiting area, in the
middle was the punching station, and on the left was the reading station.
Pressing the &quot;FEED&quot; key twice loaded one card into the punching station and one
card into the waiting area behind it. A column number indicator right above the
punching station told you which column you were currently punching. With every
keystroke, the machine would punch the requisite holes, print the appropriate
character at the top of the card, and then advance the card through the
punching station by one column. If you punched all 80 columns, the card would
automatically be released to the reading station and a new card would be loaded
into the punching station. If you wanted this to happen before you reached the
80th column, you could press the &quot;REL&quot; key (for &quot;release&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printed characters made it easy to spot a mistake. But fixing a mistake, as
the University of Michigan video warns, is not as easy as whiting out the
printed character at the top of the card and writing in a new one. The holes
are all that the computer will read. Nor is it as easy as backspacing one space
and typing in a new character. The holes have already been punched in the
column, after all, and cannot be unpunched. Punching more holes will only
produce an invalid combination not associated with any character. The IBM 029
did have a backspace button that moved the punched card backward one column,
but the button was placed on the face of the machine instead of on the
keyboard. This was probably done to discourage its use, since backspacing was
so seldom what the user actually wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the only way to correct a mistake was scrap the incorrect card and
punch a new one. This is where the reading station came in handy. Say you made
a mistake in the 68th column of a card. To fix your mistake, you could
carefully repunch the first 67 columns of a new card and then punch the correct
character in the 68th column. Alternatively, you could release the incorrect
card to the reading station, load a new card into the punching station, and
hold down the &quot;DUP&quot; key (for duplicate) until the column number indicator
reads 68. You could then correct your mistake by punching the correct
character. The reading station and the &quot;DUP&quot; key together allowed IBM 029
operators to easily copy the contents of one card to the next. There were all
sorts of reasons to do this, but correcting mistakes was the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;DUP&quot; key allowed the 029&apos;s operator to invoke the duplicate functionality
manually. But the 029 could also duplicate automatically where necessary. This
was particularly useful when punched cards were used to record data rather than
programs. For example, you might be using each card to record information about
a single undergraduate university student. On each card, you might have a field
that contains the name of that student&apos;s residence hall. Perhaps you find
yourself entering data for all the students in one residence hall at one time.
In that case, you&apos;d want the 029 to automatically copy over the previous card&apos;s
residence hall field every time you reached the first column of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated behavior like this could be programmed into the 029 by using the
program drum. The drum sat upright in the middle of the U above the punching
station. You programmed the 029 by punching holes in a card and wrapping that
card around the program drum. The punched card allowed you to specify the
automatic behavior you expected from the machine at each column of the card
currently in the punching station. You could specify that a column should
automatically be copied from the previous card, which is how an 029 operator
might more quickly enter student records. You could also specify, say, that a
particular field should contain numeric or alphabetic characters, or that a
given field should be left blank and skipped altogether. The program drum made
it much easier to punch schematized cards where certain column ranges had
special meanings. There is another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWD1PwNxpoU&quot;&gt;&quot;advanced&quot; instructional
video&lt;/a&gt; produced by the University
of Michigan that covers the program drum that is worth watching, provided, of
course, that you have already mastered the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching either of the University of Michigan videos today, what&apos;s surprising
is how easy the card punch is to operate. Correcting mistakes is tedious, but
otherwise the machine seems to be less of an obstacle than I would have
expected. Moving from one card to the next is so seamless that I can imagine
COBOL or FORTRAN programmers forgetting that they are creating separate cards
rather than one long continuous text file. On the other hand, it&apos;s interesting
to consider how card punches, even though they were only an input tool,
probably limited how early programming languages evolved. Structured
programming would eventually come along and encourage people to think of entire
blocks of code as one unit, but I can see how punch card programming&apos;s emphasis
on each line made structured programming hard to conceive of. It&apos;s no wonder
that punch card programmers were not the ones that decided to enclose blocks
with single curly braces entirely on their own lines. How wasteful that would
have seemed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even though nobody programs using punch cards anymore, every programmer
ought to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masswerk.at/keypunch/&quot;&gt;try it&lt;/a&gt; at least once—if only to
understand why COBOL and FORTRAN look the way they do, or how 80 characters
somehow became everybody&apos;s favorite character limit.&lt;/p&gt;

for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, when Berners-Lee first proposed the idea that would become the World
Wide Web, exciting things were happening in the realm of computing. A new set
of standards called TCP/IP were allowing previously isolated computer networks
to talk to each other. These standards had become popular, particularly in the
American scientific community. By 1989, TCP/IP was also just starting to be
adopted by commercial service providers like CompuServe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an annual conference had recently been established to discuss a
promising new avenue of computing research: hypertext. First conceived of in
the 1960s, hypertext found itself back in the spotlight after Apple released a
program for the Macintosh in 1987 called HyperCard. HyperCard was a kind of
simplified software development environment that allowed even the least savvy
Mac user to assemble an interactive application out of a &quot;stack&quot; of interlinked
cards. Though the cards did not contain text body hyperlinks as we think of
them today, a card could contain buttons that, when clicked, navigated to other
cards. HyperCard was tremendously successful and even beloved by many, so much
so that last year it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vipercard.net/&quot;&gt;recreated&lt;/a&gt; by a fan.
HyperCard&apos;s success inspired new interest in hypertext, which some thought
would supplant the printed word as the medium of the future. Hypertext,
according to a book published about it at the time, was going to &quot;produce
effects on our culture, particularly on our literature, education, criticism,
and scholarship just as radical as those produced by Gutenberg&apos;s movable
type.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one major problem was that, in 1989, all existing hypertext systems were
closed systems. Commercial applications of hypertext technology involved
converting complex documentation into hypertext form and then shipping it on a
floppy disk. Users could navigate the documentation more easily than if it were
printed in a book, but they could not follow links to documents not already
stored on the floppy disk. Some people, like Ted Nelson, who first coined the
term &quot;hypertext&quot; in the 1960s, were searching desperately for a way to open up
hypertext systems by making them work across a network—but these efforts were
making little progress. It took Berners-Lee, whose personal interests and
professional experiences put all the jigsaw pieces in front of him, to marry
the internet and hypertext together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/tbl_photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Berners-Lee in 1994 with his web browser.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ENQUIRE, Printers, and RPC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee had been fascinated by the promise of something like hypertext
since well before HyperCard. As a child, he had talked with his father (both
his parents were mathematicians and programmers) about how much better it would
be if computers, rather than modeling the world in rigid hierarchies, modeled
the world as a series of loose associations, the way human beings do.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In
1980, four years after graduating from Oxford University with a degree in
physics, he went to work at CERN, the particle physics laboratory in Geneva,
Switzerland. CERN, as Berners-Lee describes it in his book about the creation
of the web, had an institutional culture bordering on the anarchic.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Ten thousand or so people were nominally a part of CERN, but only half were
actually in Geneva at any given time. There were only 3000 actual, salaried
employees; the rest were contractors or itinerant academics. As a contractor
himself, Berners-Lee saw that one of the biggest challenges he faced was simply
understanding, amid the barrage of arrivals and departures, how people and
projects related to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the weather was nice, Berners-Lee and his coworkers swapped ideas while
eating lunch outside, where bucolic vineyards climbed the slopes around
them.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the evenings and during his time off, Berners-Lee worked on a
program he called ENQUIRE. ENQUIRE was his attempt to map out the tangle of
interconnections at CERN and was basically the first iteration of what would
become the web. It used hypertext to capture the relationships that human
beings would otherwise most naturally represent on a piece of paper as a set of
circles and arrows. Users could make and follow links between documents,
people, and concepts. The links were all of a certain type, so that, for
example, the &quot;Vacuum Control System&quot; concept could have an &quot;includes&quot;
relationship with the &quot;Vacuum Equipment Modules&quot; concept and a &quot;described-by&quot;
relationship with a document named &lt;em&gt;Controle du System a Vide du Booster&lt;/em&gt;.
Berners-Lee named his program after a Victorian-era domestic encyclopedia and
etiquette guide called &lt;em&gt;Enquire Within Upon Everything&lt;/em&gt;, a title he liked
because it evoked a magical portal to a world full of information.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Berners-Lee found that ENQUIRE did a pretty good job of living up to its
namesake and suited the chaotic, dynamic systems at CERN. But his contract with
CERN would end before he had an opportunity to sell other people at CERN on its
usefulness. On his way out the door, Berners-Lee handed the program to his
manager on a floppy disk, but the disk was later lost.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (ENQUIRE&apos;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/manual/&quot;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt;, however, is still
available.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENQUIRE did not work across a computer network, so like the hypertext systems
that emerged later in the 1980s, it was a closed system. It is nonetheless to
Berners-Lee&apos;s credit that he was exploring the possibilities of hypertext at
such an early stage. For ENQUIRE to transform into the World Wide Web,
Berners-Lee still needed to incorporate two more key technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these was a markup language. Serendipitously, the very next thing
Berners-Lee did after CERN was go work for his friend, John Poole, on printer
software. John Poole ran a company called Image Computer Systems that was
trying to make smarter printers by incorporating a microprocessor. Berners-Lee
helped to write, among other things, a new markup language used to prepare
documents for the printer.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; SGML, the markup language that Berners-Lee would
later base HTML on—HTML was in fact meant to be only a particular application
or &quot;tag set&quot; of SGML—was first standardized in a draft specification released
in 1980. So it&apos;s possible that, while Berners-Lee was at Image Computer
Systems, he worked with SGML. Even if he did not, the experience would
certainly have taught him a lot about the challenges inherent in trying to
render marked up text on a page, whether physical or digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1983, Berners-Lee decided he wanted to go back to working at CERN. He
applied for a fellowship and moved back to Switzerland in 1984, where he joined
CERN&apos;s Electronics and Computing for Physics division. One of his first
assignments was to develop an RPC (remote procedure call) protocol that would
allow one CERN computer to call a function stored on another CERN computer.
This might have been relatively straightforward except for the fact that CERN
computers weren&apos;t all on the same network. CERN had only grown more complex
while Berners-Lee had been away and CERN employees, accustomed to making their
own choices about technology, now used a range of computers and operating
systems from IBM, DEC, and Control Data. Consequently, there was no single set
of networking standards that all CERN computers understood. So Berners-Lee
ensured that his RPC system supported multiple networking protocols. In
particular, he made sure to support the TCP/IP protocol suite, which at that
time was championed only by CERN&apos;s Unix crowd but which Berners-Lee thought had
great potential.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That was when, as Berners-Lee writes, &quot;the Internet came into
my life.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet was the second key technology that enabled the web. Early in his
second stint at CERN, Berners-Lee had made some desultory attempts to rewrite
ENQUIRE, because he saw that the need for a program like it still existed at
CERN.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But the closed nature of ENQUIRE was too limiting. Berners-Lee began
to wonder if he could combine ENQUIRE with the communication schemes he had
developed for the RPC project. A networked version of ENQUIRE, relying on the
increasingly popular TCP/IP standards, would allow researchers at CERN to link
not only to documents on their own computers but also to documents on everyone
else&apos;s computers. At that point, all the pieces were in place. Berners-Lee told
his manager, Mike Sendall, about his ideas. Sendall told him to write a
proposal. And so, in 1989, Berners-Lee did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HyperText : Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware that CERN was unlikely to support a research project with no clear
purpose, Berners-Lee pitched his idea as the documentation system CERN
desperately lacked. With the Large Hadron Collider project just over the
horizon—today, the LHC is the largest machine on the planet—CERN needed a
better way to record and organize information. The software he was proposing,
tentatively called the information &quot;mesh,&quot; would unify the many existing
documentation systems at CERN into one easily navigated, remotely accessible
body of hypertext. Importantly, his new system would not impose any kind of
artificial hierarchy on the data being stored. In an interesting echo of Edgar
F. Codd, who &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/codd-relational-model&quot;&gt;ten years earlier&lt;/a&gt;
demonstrated the many advantages of the relational database model over the
prevailing hierarchical models, Berners-Lee warns against letting a
hierarchical method of storage put undue constraints on the information stored.
Instead, users should be able to make links between nodes in the structure
arbitrarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html&quot;&gt;original
proposal&lt;/a&gt; is light on technical
details and is almost a philosophical statement rather than a technical plan.
There is no mention of markup languages or even of anything like HTTP, though
Berners-Lee does say that an important part of the project will be defining an
interface between clients and servers. The closest he gets to describing how
his system will work in practice is when he asks his readers to imagine &quot;the
references in this document, all being associated with the network address of
the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could
skip to them with a click of the mouse.&quot; Reading the proposal today, it&apos;s
obvious to us what Berners-Lee is describing—that&apos;s the web! But, in 1989, it
would have been hard to grasp what this meta-documentation system was all
about. Sendall supposedly wrote on his copy of the proposal that it was &quot;vague
but exciting.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-11&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most intriguing thing about the proposal is that, at least in 1989,
Berners-Lee seems to have thought that he would be making a network-enabled
ENQUIRE. The diagram he includes on the first page of his proposal shows nodes
of several different kinds—there are people, concepts, documents, and software
programs—connected according to a fixed set of relationships. ENQUIRE certainly
worked that way; you had to tell it how things were related. Nodes and links
were &lt;em&gt;typed&lt;/em&gt;. But the web would not end up with typed links at all. ENQUIRE&apos;s
typed links and nodes lent themselves to interesting analysis, since you could
hypothetically ask, for example, &quot;How many people work in the Electronics and
Computing for Physics division at CERN?&quot; Answering questions like that would
not be possible on the web. A decade later, Berners-Lee and hundreds of others
would &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/semantic-web&quot;&gt;try to bring typing back&lt;/a&gt; by
encouraging everyone to use semantic web technologies, with only mixed success.
It&apos;s fascinating to know that the web, at least as originally conceived, was
supposed to be a semantic web all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/web_diagram.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The diagram from the cover of the 1989 proposal.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee sent his proposal around to a few people at CERN, but it was, for
the most part, politely ignored. A year later, Berners-Lee, more convinced than
ever that he was on to something, worked with CERN veteran Robert Cailliau to
rewrite his original proposal in more concrete terms.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-12&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Proposal.html&quot;&gt;1990
proposal&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the resources that would
be required to build a working prototype of what Berners-Lee was now calling
&quot;WorldWideWeb.&quot; It also specifies that the project would involve creating,
among other things, a standard protocol for retrieving documents, a standard
format for representing documents, and a program that would allow users to view
retrieved text documents and possibly graphics. This second proposal allowed
Berners-Lee to pull together a small team and start creating the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that Berners-Lee worked on was a client. Berners-Lee&apos;s manager,
Mike Sendall, had just allowed him to purchase a NeXTSTEP workstation. NeXTSTEP
was a new operating system produced by NeXT, the company that Steve Jobs
founded after being ousted from Apple. Berners-Lee had decided that the
NeXTSTEP system, known for its powerful and easy-to-use software development
framework, would make developing the &quot;browser&quot; program straightforward.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-13&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Indeed, the framework, written in Objective-C and leveraging the latest new
programming paradigm (something called &quot;object-oriented programming&quot;), made it
as easy as creating a new subclass of the existing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; class called
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HyperText&lt;/code&gt;. Other classes Berners-Lee wrote had the prefix &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HT&lt;/code&gt;, for
hypertext, because prefixing class names was a convention when using NeXTSTEP&apos;s
application framework. If this seems familiar to anyone, that&apos;s because NeXT
eventually got bought by Apple. The AppKit framework that iOS and Mac
developers know so well today is only the modern incarnation of the framework
Berners-Lee used to build the first web browser. Berners-Lee&apos;s browser,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;WorldWideWeb.app&lt;/code&gt;, even had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sinclairtarget/www-beginnings/blob/master/1991-WWW-NeXT/Implementation/HyperManager.m&quot;&gt;application
delegate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other piece of software that Berners-Lee had to write was a basic HTTP
server. That code would eventually become known as CERN HTTPd. The original
version ran on NeXT systems and on an operating system called VAX/VMS,
developed by Digital Equipment Corporation and popular among some people at
CERN. The original version fit inside one file, named
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sinclairtarget/www-beginnings/blob/master/cern-httpd/v0.1/daemon.c&quot;&gt;daemon.c&lt;/a&gt;,
which is well worth reading through. By default, the first HTTP server ran on
port 2784 and supported only &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests and another kind of request called
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FIND&lt;/code&gt;. It implemented the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html&quot;&gt;original HTTP
specification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, Berners-Lee had a client and a server talking to each other using
HTTP. But the web browser he had built only ran on NeXT machines, which would
have a long legacy in computing but which were not, in fact, all that popular.
This bothered Berners-Lee, because the whole point of having a world-wide web
was that it would be universal. A web browser that only ran on one system did
not do a good job of demonstrating the web&apos;s potential. So on the advice of
another CERN employee, Ben Segal, Berners-Lee hired an intern named Nicola
Pellow to create what they called a &quot;line-mode&quot; browser.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-14&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The line-mode
browser would be text-only, making it easy to port to lots of different
systems. Few people remember the line-mode browser now, but many more people
first encountered the web via the line-mode browser than via Berners-Lee&apos;s
original NeXT browser. The cool thing about the line-mode browser is that CERN
has recently created an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://line-mode.cern.ch/www/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html&quot;&gt;emulation&lt;/a&gt; of it,
so if you&apos;re idea of fun involves browsing the web like it&apos;s 1991, this is
something you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Web Goes Public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee first told people outside of CERN about the web when he described
it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/1991/08/art-6484.txt&quot;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; to
the alt.hypertext newsgroup made in August of 1991. He was responding to a
question somebody else had asked about whether anyone was working on a
hypertext system that could retrieve information from &quot;heterogeneous&quot; sources.
In the post, Berners-Lee lays out the work that had been done so far on the
&quot;WorldWideWeb&quot; project and invites anyone interested in seeing the code to
email him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, in September, the web spread outside of Europe to the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. From there it spread to other research centers
around the world. Other people began making their own web browsers for
different operating systems and some of these web browsers were dramatic
improvements on Berners-Lee&apos;s original browser. In 1993, a team of young
graduate students at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in
Illinois created Mosaic, which among other achievements was the first browser
to display images inline instead of in a separate window. Mosaic was so easy to
install and use that it kicked off a massive boom in the popularity of the web
and effectively ushered in the internet age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Mosaic launched, the web had long ceased to be under Berners-Lee&apos;s
sole control. Other people would have greater influence over its evolution and
growth in the years to come. But the web would, of course, always be remembered
as Berners-Lee&apos;s invention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could anyone else have invented the web? As is sometimes the case with new
technologies, in 1989, the web—or at least something like it—seems to have been
almost inevitable. Interest in hypertext was growing even as TCP/IP made it
easier for different computer systems to talk to each other. Questions like the
one asked on the alt.hypertext newsgroup about hypertext connecting
&quot;heterogeneous&quot; systems show that other people were beginning to see the
potential of such a system. Then again, people like Ted Nelson spent years
trying to create a universal hypertext system without getting anywhere.
Berners-Lee, fortunate enough to have worked with, in short order, hypertext
systems, markup languages, and RPC protocols, was uniquely situated to bring
those strands together. Without Berners-Lee, a &quot;web&quot; may eventually have
emerged, but it might not have happened for several more years and it might not
have resembled the free and open web that Berners-Lee gave us.&lt;/p&gt;

in Scientific American. Berners-Lee, along with two other researchers, Ora
Lassila and James Hendler, wanted to give the world a preview of the
revolutionary new changes they saw coming to the web. Since its introduction
only a decade before, the web had fast become the world&apos;s best means for
sharing documents with other people. Now, the authors promised, the web would
evolve to encompass not just documents but every kind of data one could
imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called this new web the Semantic Web. The great promise of the Semantic
Web was that it would be readable not just by humans but also by machines.
Pages on the web would be &lt;em&gt;meaningful&lt;/em&gt; to software programs—they would have
semantics—allowing programs to interact with the web the same way that people
do. Programs could exchange data across the Semantic Web without having to be
explicitly engineered to talk to each other. According to Berners-Lee, Lassila,
and Hendler, a typical day living with the myriad conveniences of the Semantic
Web might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The entertainment system was belting out the Beatles&apos; &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;
when the phone rang. When Pete answered, his phone turned the sound down by
sending a message to all the other local devices that had a volume control.
His sister, Lucy, was on the line from the doctor&apos;s office: &quot;Mom needs to see
a specialist and then has to have a series of physical therapy sessions.
Biweekly or something. I&apos;m going to have my agent set up the appointments.&quot;
Pete immediately agreed to share the chauffeuring. At the doctor&apos;s office,
Lucy instructed her Semantic Web agent through her handheld Web browser. The
agent promptly retrieved the information about Mom&apos;s prescribed treatment
within a 20-mile radius of her home and with a rating of excellent or very
good on trusted rating services. It then began trying to find a match between
available appointment times (supplied by the agents of individual providers
through their Web sites) and Pete&apos;s and Lucy&apos;s busy schedules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision was that the Semantic Web would become a playground for intelligent
&quot;agents.&quot; These agents would automate much of the work that the world had only
just learned to do on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/scientific_american_cover.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, this vision enticed a lot of people. After new technologies such
as AJAX led to the rise of what Silicon Valley called Web 2.0, Berners-Lee
began referring to the Semantic Web as Web 3.0. Many thought that the Semantic
Web was indeed the inevitable next step. A New York Times article published in
2006 quotes a speech Berners-Lee gave at a conference in which he said that the
extant web would, twenty years in the future, be seen as only the &quot;embryonic&quot;
form of something far greater.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A venture capitalist, also quoted in the
article, claimed that the Semantic Web would be &quot;profound,&quot; and ultimately &quot;as
obvious as the web seems obvious to us today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Semantic Web we were promised has yet to be delivered. In 2018,
we have &quot;agents&quot; like Siri that can do certain tasks for us. But Siri can only
do what it can because engineers at Apple have manually hooked it up to a
medley of web services each capable of answering only a narrow category of
questions. An important consequence is that, without being large and important
enough for Apple to care, you cannot advertise your services directly to Siri
from your own website. Unlike the physical therapists that Berners-Lee and his
co-authors imagined would be able to hang out their shingles on the web, today
we are stuck with giant, centralized repositories of information. Today&apos;s
physical therapists must enter information about their practice into Google or
Yelp, because those are the only services that the smartphone agents know how
to use and the only ones human beings will bother to check. The key difference
between our current reality and the promised Semantic future is best captured
by this throwaway aside in the excerpt above: &quot;&lt;em&gt;...appointment times (supplied
by the agents of individual providers through &lt;strong&gt;their&lt;/strong&gt; Web sites)...&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, over the last decade, the web has not only failed to become the
Semantic Web but also threatened to recede as an idea altogether. We now hardly
ever talk about &quot;the web&quot; and instead talk about &quot;the internet,&quot; which as of
2016 has become such a common term that newspapers no longer capitalize it. (To
be fair, they stopped capitalizing &quot;web&quot; too.) Some might still protest that
the web and the internet are two different things, but the distinction gets
less clear all the time. The web we have today is slowly becoming a glorified
app store, just the easiest way among many to download software that
communicates with distant servers using closed protocols and schemas, making it
functionally identical to the software ecosystem that existed before the web.
How did we get here? If the effort to build a Semantic Web had succeeded, would
the web have looked different today? Or have there been so many forces working
against a decentralized web for so long that the Semantic Web was always going
to be stillborn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Semweb Hucksters and Their Metacrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some more practically minded engineers, the Semantic Web was, from the
outset, a utopian dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea behind the Semantic Web was that everyone would use a new set of
standards to annotate their webpages with little bits of XML. These little bits
of XML would have no effect on the presentation of the webpage, but they could
be read by software programs to divine meaning that otherwise would only be
available to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bits of XML were a way of expressing &lt;em&gt;metadata&lt;/em&gt; about the webpage. We are
all familiar with metadata in the context of a file system: When we look at a
file on our computers, we can see when it was created, when it was last
updated, and whom it was originally created by. Likewise, webpages on the
Semantic Web would be able to tell your browser who authored the page and
perhaps even where that person went to school, or where that person is
currently employed. In theory, this information would allow Semantic Web
browsers to answer queries across a large collection of webpages. In their
article for Scientific American, Berners-Lee and his co-authors explain that
you could, for example, use the Semantic Web to look up a person you met at a
conference whose name you only partially remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cory Doctorow, a blogger and digital rights activist, published an influential
essay in 2001 that pointed out the many problems with depending on voluntarily
supplied metadata. A world of &quot;exhaustive, reliable&quot; metadata would be
wonderful, he argued, but such a world was &quot;a pipe-dream, founded on
self-delusion, nerd hubris, and hysterically inflated market
opportunities.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Doctorow had found himself in a series of debates over the
Semantic Web at tech conferences and wanted to catalog the serious issues that
the Semantic Web enthusiasts (Doctorow calls them &quot;semweb hucksters&quot;) were
overlooking.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The essay, titled &quot;Metacrap,&quot; identifies seven problems, among
them the obvious fact that most web users were likely to provide either no
metadata at all or else lots of misleading metadata meant to draw clicks. Even
if users were universally diligent and well-intentioned, in order for the
metadata to be robust and reliable, users would all have to agree on a single
representation for each important concept. Doctorow argued that in some cases a
single representation might not be appropriate, desirable, or fair to all
users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the web had already seen people abusing the HTML &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag
(introduced at least as early as HTML 4) in an attempt to improve the
visibility of their webpages in search results. In a 2004 paper, Ben Munat,
then an academic at Evergreen State College, explains how search engines once
experimented with using keywords supplied via the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to index
results, but soon discovered that unscrupulous webpage authors were including
tags unrelated to the actual content of their webpage.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As a result, search
engines came to ignore the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in favor of using complex algorithms to
analyze the actual content of a webpage. Munat concludes that a
general-purpose Semantic Web is unworkable, and that the focus should be on
specific domains within medicine and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have also seen the Semantic Web project as tragically flawed, though
they have located the flaw elsewhere. Aaron Swartz, the famous programmer and
another digital rights activist, wrote in an unfinished book about the
Semantic Web published after his death that Doctorow was &quot;attacking a
strawman.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nobody expected that metadata on the web would be thoroughly
accurate and reliable, but the Semantic Web, or at least a more realistically
scoped version of it, remained possible. The problem, in Swartz&apos; view, was the
&quot;formalizing mindset of mathematics and the institutional structure of
academics&quot; that the &quot;semantic Webheads&quot; brought to bear on the challenge. In
forums like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a huge amount of effort and
discussion went into creating standards before there were any applications out
there to standardize.  And the standards that emerged from these &quot;Talmudic
debates&quot; were so abstract that few of them ever saw widespread adoption. The
few that did, like XML, were &quot;uniformly scourges on the planet, offenses
against hardworking programmers that have pushed out sensible formats (like
JSON) in favor of overly-complicated hairballs with no basis in reality.&quot; The
Semantic Web might have thrived if, like the original web, its standards were
eagerly adopted by everyone. But that never happened because—as &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/the-rise-and-rise-of-json/&quot;&gt;has been
discussed&lt;/a&gt; on this
blog before—the putative benefits of something like XML are not easy to sell to
a programmer when the alternatives are both entirely sufficient and much easier
to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building the Semantic Web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Semantic Web was not an outright impossibility, it was always going to
require the contributions of lots of clever people working in concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long effort to build the Semantic Web has been said to consist of four
phases.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The first phase, which lasted from 2001 to 2005, was the golden age
of Semantic Web activity. Between 2001 and 2005, the W3C issued a slew of new
standards laying out the foundational technologies of the Semantic future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important of these was the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The
W3C issued the first version of the RDF standard in 2004, but RDF had been
floating around since 1997, when a W3C working group introduced it in a draft
specification. RDF was originally conceived of as a tool for modeling metadata
and was partly based on earlier attempts by Ramanathan Guha, an Apple engineer,
to develop a metadata system for files stored on Apple computers.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
Semantic Web working groups at W3C repurposed RDF to represent arbitrary kinds
of general knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RDF would be the grammar in which Semantic webpages expressed information. The
grammar is a simple one: Facts about the world are expressed in RDF as triplets
of subject, predicate, and object. Tim Bray, who worked with Ramanathan Guha on
an early version of RDF, gives the following example, describing TV shows and
movies: &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .

@prefix ex: &amp;lt;http://www.example.org/&amp;gt; .


ex:vincent_donofrio ex:starred_in ex:law_and_order_ci .

ex:law_and_order_ci rdf:type ex:tv_show .

ex:the_thirteenth_floor ex:similar_plot_as ex:the_matrix .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax is not important, especially since RDF can be represented in a
number of formats, including XML and JSON. This example is in a format called
Turtle, which expresses RDF triplets as straightforward sentences terminated by
periods. The three essential sentences, which appear above after the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@prefix&lt;/code&gt;
preamble, state three facts: Vincent Donofrio starred in &lt;em&gt;Law and Order&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Law
and Order&lt;/em&gt; is a type of TV Show, and the movie &lt;em&gt;The Thirteenth Floor&lt;/em&gt; has a
similar plot as &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;. (If you don&apos;t know who Vincent Donofrio is and
have never seen &lt;em&gt;The Thirteenth Floor&lt;/em&gt;, I, too, was watching Nickelodeon and
sipping Capri Suns in 1999.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other specifications finalized and drafted during this first era of Semantic
Web development describe all the ways in which RDF can be used. RDF in
Attributes (RDFa) defines how RDF can be embedded in HTML so that browsers,
search engines, and other programs can glean meaning from a webpage. RDF Schema
and another standard called OWL allows RDF authors to demarcate the boundary
between valid and invalid RDF statements in their RDF documents. RDF Schema and
OWL, in other words, are tools for creating what are known as ontologies,
explicit specifications of what can and cannot be said within a specific
domain. An ontology might include a rule, for example, expressing that no
person can be the mother of another person without also being a parent of that
person. The hope was that these ontologies would be widely used not only to
check the accuracy of RDF found in the wild but also to make inferences about
omitted information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Tim Berners-Lee posted a short article in which he argued that the
existing work on Semantic Web standards needed to be supplemented by a
concerted effort to make semantic data available on the web.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore,
once on the web, it was important that semantic data link to other kinds of
semantic data, ensuring the rise of a data-based web as interconnected as the
existing web. Berners-Lee used the term &quot;linked data&quot; to describe this ideal
scenario.  Though &quot;linked data&quot; was in one sense just a recapitulation of the
original vision for the Semantic Web, it became a term that people could rally
around and thus amounted to a rebranding of the Semantic Web project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee&apos;s article launched the second phase of the Semantic Web&apos;s
development, where the focus shifted from setting standards and building toy
examples to creating and popularizing large RDF datasets. Perhaps the most
successful of these datasets was &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.dbpedia.org/&quot;&gt;DBpedia&lt;/a&gt;, a giant
repository of RDF triplets extracted from Wikipedia articles. DBpedia, which
made heavy use of the Semantic Web standards that had been developed in the
first half of the 2000s, was a standout example of what could be accomplished
using the W3C&apos;s new formats. Today DBpedia describes 4.58 million entities and
is used by organizations like the NY Times, BBC, and IBM, which employed
DBpedia as a knowledge source for IBM Watson, the Jeopardy-winning artificial
intelligence system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/linked_data.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third phase of the Semantic Web&apos;s development involved adapting the W3C&apos;s
standards to fit the actual practices and preferences of web developers. By
2008, JSON had begun its meteoric rise to popularity. Whereas XML came packaged
with a bunch of associated technologies of indeterminate purpose (XLST, XPath,
XQuery, XLink), JSON was just JSON. It was less verbose and more readable. Manu
Sporny, an entrepreneur and member of the W3C, had already started using JSON
at his company and wanted to find an easy way for RDFa and JSON to work
together.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-11&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The result would be JSON-LD, which in essence was RDF reimagined
for a world that had chosen JSON over XML. Sporny, together with his CTO, Dave
Longley, issued a draft specification of JSON-LD in 2010. For the next few
years, JSON-LD and an updated RDF specification would be the primary focus of
Semantic Web work at the W3C. JSON-LD could be used on its own or it could be
embedded within a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag on an HTML page, making it an alternative to
both RDF and RDFa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on JSON-LD coincided with the development of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/&quot;&gt;schema.org&lt;/a&gt;, a centralized collection of simple schemas
for describing things that might exist on the web. schema.org was started by
Google, Bing, and Yahoo with the express purpose of delivering better search
results by agreeing to a common set of vocabularies. schema.org vocabularies,
together with JSON-LD, are now used to drive features like Google&apos;s Knowledge
Graph. The approach was a more practical and less abstract one, where immediate
applications in search results were the focus. The schema.org team are careful
to state on their website that they are not attempting to create a &quot;universal
ontology.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-12&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, work on the Semantic Web seems to have petered out. The W3C still does
some work on the Semantic Web under the heading of &quot;Data Activity,&quot; which might
charitably be called the fourth phase of the Semantic Web project. But it&apos;s
telling that the most recent &quot;Data Activity&quot; project is a study of what the W3C
must do to improve its standardization process.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-13&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even the W3C now appears
to recognize that few of its Semantic Web standards have been widely adopted
and that simpler standards would have been more successful. The attitude at the
W3C seems to be one of retrenchment and introspection, perhaps in the hope of
being better prepared when the Semantic Web looks promising again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Lingering Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the Semantic Web, as colorfully described by one person, is &quot;as dead as
last year&apos;s roadkill.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-14&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At least, the version of the Semantic Web
originally proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, which once seemed to be the imminent
future of the web, is unlikely to emerge soon. That said, many of the
technologies and ideas that were developed amid the push to create the
Semantic Web have been repurposed and live on in various applications. As
already mentioned, Google relies on Semantic Web technologies—now primarily
JSON-LD—to generate useful conceptual summaries next to search results.
schema.org maintains a list of &quot;vocabularies&quot; that web developers can use to
publish easily understood data for a wide audience—it is a new, more practical
imagining of what a public, shared ontology might look like. And to some
degree, the many REST APIs now available constitute a diminished Semantic Web.
What wasn&apos;t possible in 2001 now is: You can easily build applications that
make use of data from across the web. The difference is that you must sign up
for each API one by one beforehand, which in addition to being wearisome also
gives whoever hosts the API enormous control over how you access their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another modern application of Semantic Web technologies, perhaps the most
popular and successful in recent years outside of Google, is Facebook&apos;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ogp.me/&quot;&gt;OpenGraph&lt;/a&gt; protocol. The OpenGraph protocol defines a schema
that web developers can use (via RDFa) to determine how a web page is displayed
when shared in a social media application. For example, a web developer working
at the New York Times might use OpenGraph to specify the title and thumbnail
that should appear when a New York Times article is shared in Facebook. In one
sense, this is an application of Semantic Web technologies true to the Semantic
Web&apos;s origins in research on metadata. Tagging a webpage with extra information
about who wrote it and what it is about is exactly the kind of metadata
authoring the Semantic Web was going to depend on. But in another sense,
OpenGraph is an application of Semantic Web technologies to further a purpose
somewhat at odds with the philosophy of the web. The metadata isn&apos;t meant to be
general-purpose, after all. People tag their webpages using OpenGraph because
they want links to their content to unfurl properly in Facebook. And the more
information Facebook knows about your website, the closer Facebook gets to
simply reproducing your entire website within Facebook, portending a future
where the open web is a mythical land beyond Facebook&apos;s towering blue walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s fascinating about JSON-LD and OpenGraph is that you can use them without
knowing anything about subject-predicate-object triplets, RDF, RDF Schema,
ontologies, OWL, or really any other Semantic Web technologies—you don&apos;t even
have to know XML. Manu Sporny has even said that the JSON-LD working group at
W3C made a special effort to avoid references to RDF in the JSON-LD
specification.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-15&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is almost certainly why these technologies have
succeeded and continue to be popular. Nobody wants to use a tool that can only
be fully understood by reading a whole family of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s interesting to consider what might have happened if simple formats like
JSON-LD had appeared earlier. The Semantic Web could have sidestepped its fatal
association with XML. More people might have been tempted to mark up their
websites with RDF, but even that may not have saved the Semantic Web. Sean B.
Palmer, an Internet Person that has scrubbed all biographical information about
himself from the internet but who claims to have worked in the Semantic Web
world for a while in the 2000s, posits that the real problem was the lack of
a truly decentralized infrastructure to host the Semantic Web on.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-16&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To host
your own website, you need to buy a domain name from ICANN, configure it
correctly using DNS, and then pay someone to host your content if you don&apos;t
already have a server of your own. We shouldn&apos;t be surprised if the average
person finds it easier to enter their information into a giant, corporate data
repository. And in a web of giant, corporate data repositories, there are no
compelling use cases for Semantic Web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the problems that confronted the Semantic Web were more numerous and
profound than just &quot;XML sucks.&quot; All the same, it&apos;s hard to believe that the
Semantic Web is truly dead and gone. Some of the particular technologies that
the W3C dreamed up in the early 2000s may not have a future, but the
decentralized vision of the web that Tim Berners-Lee and his follow researchers
described in Scientific American is too compelling to simply disappear. Imagine
a web where, rather than filling out the same tedious form every time you
register for a service, you were somehow able to authorize services to get that
information from your own website. Imagine a Facebook that keeps &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; list of
friends, hosted on &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt; website, up-to-date, rather than vice-versa.
Basically, the Semantic Web was going to be a web where everyone gets to have
their own personal REST API, whether they know the first thing about computers
or not.  Conceived of that way, it&apos;s easy to see why the Semantic Web hasn&apos;t
yet been realized.  There are so many engineering and security issues to sort
out between here and there. But it&apos;s also easy to see why the dream of the
Semantic Web seduced so many people.&lt;/p&gt;

kid on the block. In 2017, the relational model competes with all sorts of
cutting-edge NoSQL technologies that make relational database systems seem
old-fashioned and boring. Yet, 50 years ago, none of the dominant database
systems were relational. Nobody had thought to structure their data that way.
When the relational model did come along, it was a radical new idea that
revolutionized the database world and spawned a multi-billion dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relational model was introduced in 1970. Edgar F. Codd, a researcher at
IBM, published a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~david/cs848s14/codd-relational.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; called &quot;A
Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.&quot; The paper was a rewrite
of a paper he had circulated internally at IBM a year earlier. The paper is
unassuming; Codd does not announce in his abstract that he has discovered a
brilliant new approach to storing data. He only claims to have employed a novel
tool (the mathematical notion of a &quot;relation&quot;) to address some of the
inadequacies of the prevailing database models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970, there were two schools of thought about how to structure a database:
the hierarchical model and the network model. The hierarchical model was used
by IBM&apos;s Information Management System (IMS), the dominant database system at
the time. The network model had been specified by a standards committee called
CODASYL (which also—random tidbit—specified COBOL) and implemented by several
other database system vendors. The two models were not really that different;
both could be called &quot;navigational&quot; models. They persisted tree or graph data
structures to disk using pointers to preserve the links between the data.
Retrieving a record stored toward the bottom of the tree would involve first
navigating through all of its ancestor records. These databases were fast (IMS
is still used by many financial institutions partly for this reason, see &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/the-most-important-database/&quot;&gt;this
excellent blog post&lt;/a&gt;)
but inflexible. Woe unto those database administrators who suddenly found
themselves needing to query records from the bottom of the tree without having
an obvious place to start at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codd saw this inflexibility as a symptom of a larger problem. Programs using a
hierarchical or network database had to know about how the stored data was
structured. Programs had to know this because they were responsible for
navigating down this structure to find the information they needed. This was so
true that when Charles Bachman, a major pioneer of the network model, received
a Turing Award for his work in 1973, he gave a speech titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f371/d196bf0e7b43df6dcbbc44de461925a21709.pdf&quot;&gt;The Programmer
as
Navigator&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;
Of course, if programs were saddled with this responsibility, then they would
immediately break if the structure of the database ever changed. In the
introduction to his 1970 paper, Codd motivates the search for a better model by
arguing that we need &quot;data independence,&quot; which he defines as &quot;the independence
of application programs and terminal activities from growth in data types and
changes in data representation.&quot; The relational model, he argues, &quot;appears to
be superior in several respects to the graph or network model presently in
vogue,&quot; partly because, among other benefits, the relational model &quot;provides a
means of describing data with its natural structure only.&quot; By this he meant
that programs could safely ignore any artificial structures (like trees)
imposed upon the data for storage and retrieval purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further illustrate the problem with the navigational models, Codd devotes
the first section of his paper to an example data set involving machine parts
and assembly projects. This dataset, he says, could be represented in existing
systems in at least five different ways. Any program &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;P&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.13889em;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that is developed
assuming one of five structures will fail when run against at least three of
the other structures. The program &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;P&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.13889em;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could instead try to figure out ahead of
time which of the structures it might be dealing with, but it would be
difficult to do so in this specific case and practically impossible in the
general case. So, as long as the program needs to know about how the data is
structured, we cannot switch to an alternative structure without breaking the
program. This is a real bummer because (and this is from the abstract) &quot;changes
in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query,
update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored
information.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codd then introduces his relational model. This model would be refined and
expanded in subsequent papers: In 1971, Codd wrote about ALPHA, a SQL-like
query language he created; in another 1971 paper, he introduced the first three
normal forms we know and love today; and in 1972, he further developed
relational algebra and relational calculus, the mathematically rigorous
underpinnings of the relational model. But Codd&apos;s 1970 paper contains the
kernel of the relational idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;relation&lt;/em&gt; is used here in its accepted mathematical sense. Given
sets &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator=&quot;true&quot;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator=&quot;true&quot;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;.&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;.&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;.&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator=&quot;true&quot;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;S_1, S_i, ..., S_n&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot;

As defined above,
&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;R&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;R&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.00773em;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is said to have &lt;em&gt;degree&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;n&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Relations of degree 1 are often called
&lt;em&gt;unary&lt;/em&gt;, degree 2 &lt;em&gt;binary&lt;/em&gt;, degree 3 &lt;em&gt;ternary&lt;/em&gt;, and degree &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;n&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathdefault&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;n-ary&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we call a &lt;em&gt;relation&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;table&lt;/em&gt;, and a &lt;em&gt;domain&lt;/em&gt; an &lt;em&gt;attribute&lt;/em&gt; or a
&lt;em&gt;column&lt;/em&gt;. The word &quot;table&quot; actually appears nowhere in the paper, though Codd&apos;s
visual representations of relations (which he calls &quot;arrays&quot;) do resemble
tables. Codd defines several more terms, some of which we continue to use and
others we have replaced. He explains primary and foreign keys, as well as what
he calls the &quot;active domain,&quot; which is the set of all distinct values that
actually appear in a given domain or column. He then spends some time
distinguishing between a &quot;simple&quot; and a &quot;nonsimple&quot; domain. A simple domain
contains &quot;atomic&quot; or &quot;nondecomposable&quot; values, like integers. A nonsimple
domain has relations as elements. The example Codd gives here is that of an
employee with a salary history. The salary history is not one salary but a
collection of salaries each associated with a date. So a salary history cannot
be represented by a single number or string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not obvious how one could store a nonsimple domain in a multi-dimensional
array, AKA a table. The temptation might be to denote the nonsimple
relationship using some kind of pointer, but then we would be repeating the
mistakes of the navigational models. Instead. Codd introduces normalization,
which at least in the 1970 paper involves nothing more than turning nonsimple
domains into simple ones. This is done by expanding the child relation so that
it includes the primary key of the parent. Each tuple of the child relation
references its parent using simple domains, eliminating the need for a
nonsimple domain in the parent. Normalization means no pointers, sidestepping
all the problems they cause in the navigational models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, anyone reading Codd&apos;s paper would have several questions, such
as &quot;Okay, how would I actually query such a system?&quot; Codd mentions the
possibility of creating a universal sublanguage for querying relational
databases from other programs, but declines to define such a language in this
particular paper. He does explain, in mathematical terms, many of the
fundamental operations such a language would have to support, like joins,
&quot;projection&quot; (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; in SQL), and &quot;restriction&quot; (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt;). The amazing thing
about Codd&apos;s 1970 paper is that, really, all the ideas are there—we&apos;ve been
writing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statements and joins for almost half a century now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codd wraps up the paper by discussing ways in which a normalized relational
database, on top of its other benefits, can reduce redundancy and improve
consistency in data storage. Altogether, the paper is only 11 pages long and
not that difficult of a read. I encourage you to look through it yourself. It
would be another ten years before Codd&apos;s ideas were properly implemented in a
functioning system, but, when they finally were, those systems were so obviously
better than previous systems that they took the world by storm.&lt;/p&gt;

build-it-yourself home computer kit released in 1975. The Altair was basically
the first personal computer, though it predated the advent of that term by
several years. It is Adam (or Eve) to every Dell, HP, or Macbook out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people thought it&apos;d be awesome to write an emulator for the Z80—a
processor closely related to the Altair&apos;s Intel 8080—and then thought it needed
a simulation of the Altair&apos;s control panel on top of it. So if you&apos;ve ever
wondered what it was like to use a computer in 1975, you can run the Altair on
your Macbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/altair.png&quot; alt=&quot;Altair 8800&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download Z80 pack from the FTP server available
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/ftp/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You&apos;re looking for the
latest Z80 pack release, something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;z80pack-1.26.tgz&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First unpack the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ tar -xvf z80pack-1.26.tgz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move into the unpacked directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cd z80pack-1.26&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control panel simulation is based on a library called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;frontpanel&lt;/code&gt;. You&apos;ll
have to compile that library first. If you move into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;frontpanel&lt;/code&gt;
directory, you will find a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; file listing the libraries own
dependencies. Your experience here will almost certainly differ from mine, but
perhaps my travails will be illustrative. I had the dependencies installed, but
via &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;. To get the library to compile I just had to
make sure that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/usr/local/include&lt;/code&gt; was added to Clang&apos;s include path in
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Makefile.osx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve satisfied the dependencies, you should be able to compile the library
(we&apos;re now in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;z80pack-1.26/frontpanel&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ make -f Makefile.osx ...
$ make -f Makefile.osx clean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should end up with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;libfrontpanel.so&lt;/code&gt;. I copied this to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/usr/local/lib&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Altair simulator is under &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;z80pack-1.26/altairsim&lt;/code&gt;. You now need to compile
the simulator itself. Move into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;z80pack-1.26/altairsim/srcsim&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;
once more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ make -f Makefile.osx ...
$ make -f Makefile.osx clean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That process will create an executable called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;altairsim&lt;/code&gt; one level up in
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;z80pack-1.26/altairsim&lt;/code&gt;. Run that executable and you should see that iconic
Altair control panel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you really want to nerd out, read through the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/altair/d/88opman.pdf&quot;&gt;Altair
manual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

it hard to express why that is. The best I&apos;ve been able to do is this musical
analogy: Whereas Python feels to me like punk rock—it&apos;s simple, predictable,
but rigid—Ruby feels like jazz. Ruby gives programmers a radical freedom to
express themselves, though that comes at the cost of added complexity and can
lead to programmers writing programs that don&apos;t make immediate sense to other
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve always been aware that freedom of expression is a core value of the Ruby
community. But what I didn&apos;t appreciate is how deeply important it was to the
development and popularization of Ruby in the first place. One might create a
programming lanugage in pursuit of better peformance, or perhaps timesaving
abstractions—the Ruby story is interesting because instead the goal was, from
the very beginning, nothing more or less than the happiness of the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yukihiro Matsumoto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as &quot;Matz,&quot; graduated from the University of
Tsukuba in 1990. Tsukuba is a small town just northeast of Tokyo, known as a
center for scientific research and technological devlopment. The University of
Tsukuba is particularly well-regarded for its STEM programs. Matsumoto studied
Information Science, with a focus on programming languages. For a time he
worked in a programming language lab run by Ikuo Nakata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto started working on Ruby in 1993, only a few years after graduating.
He began working on Ruby because he was looking for a scripting language with
features that no existing scripting language could provide. He was using Perl
at the time, but felt that it was too much of a &quot;toy language.&quot; Python also
fell short; in his own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew Python then. But I didn&apos;t like it, because I didn&apos;t think it was a
true object-oriented language—OO features appeared to be an add-on to the
language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a
genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for one,
but couldn&apos;t find one.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one way of understanding Matsumoto&apos;s motivations in creating Ruby is that he
was trying to create a better, object-oriented version of Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at other times, Matsumoto has said that his primary motivation in creating
Ruby was simply to make himself and others happier. Toward the end of a Google
tech talk that Matsumoto gave in 2008, he showed the following slide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/matz.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told his audience,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and
to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of the
Ruby language.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsumoto goes on to joke that he created Ruby for selfish reasons, because he
was so underwhelmed by other languages that he just wanted to create something
that would make him happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slide epitomizes Matsumoto&apos;s humble style. Matsumoto, it turns out, is a
practicing Mormon, and I&apos;ve wondered whether his religious commitments have any
bearing on his legendary kindness. In any case, this kindness is so well known
that the Ruby community has a principle known as MINASWAN, or &quot;Matz Is Nice And
So We Are Nice.&quot; The slide must have struck the audience at Google as an
unusual one—I imagine that any random slide drawn from a Google tech talk is
dense with code samples and metrics showing how one engineering solution is
faster or more efficient than another. Few, I suspect, come close to stating
nobler goals more simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby was influenced primarily by Perl. Perl was created by Larry Wall in the
late 1980s as a means of processing and transforming text-based reports. It
became well-known for its text processing and regular expression capabilities.
A Perl program contains many syntactic elements that would be familiar to a
Ruby programmer—there are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; signs, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; signs, and even &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt;s, which I&apos;d
always thought were one of Ruby&apos;s less felicitous idiosyncracies. On a deeper
level, Ruby borrows much of Perl&apos;s regular expression handling and standard
library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Perl was by no means the only influence on Ruby. Prior to beginning work on
Ruby, Matsumoto worked on a mail client written entirely in Emacs Lisp. The
experience taught him a lot about the inner workings of Emacs and the Lisp
language, which Matsumoto has said influenced the underlying object model of
Ruby. On top of that he added a Smalltalk-style messsage passing system which
forms the basis for any behavior relying on Ruby&apos;s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#method_missing&lt;/code&gt;. Matsumoto
has also claimed Ada and Eiffel as influences on Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time to decide on a name for Ruby, Matsumoto and a colleague,
Keiju Ishitsuka, considered several alternatives. They were looking for
something that suggested Ruby&apos;s relationship to Perl and also to shell
scripting. In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/88819&quot;&gt;instant message
exchange&lt;/a&gt;
that is well-worth reading, Ishitsuka and Matsumoto probably spend too much
time thinking about the relationship between shells, clams, oysters, and
pearls and get close to calling the Ruby language &quot;Coral&quot; or &quot;Bisque&quot; instead.
Thankfully, they decided to go with &quot;Ruby&quot;, the idea being that it was, like
&quot;pearl&quot;, the name of a valuable jewel. It also turns out that the birthstone
for June is a pearl while the birthstone for July is a ruby, meaning that the
name &quot;Ruby&quot; is another tongue-in-cheek &quot;incremental improvement&quot; name like C++
or C#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ruby Goes West&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby grew popular in Japan very quickly. Soon after its initial release in
1995, Matz was hired by a Japanese software consulting group called Netlab
(also known as Network Applied Communication Laboratory) to work on Ruby
full-time. By 2000, only five years after it was initially released, Ruby was
more popular in Japan than Python. But it was only just beginning to make its
way to English-speaking countries. There had been a Japanese-language mailing
list for Ruby discussion since almost the very beginning of Ruby&apos;s existence,
but the English-language mailing list wasn&apos;t started until 1998. Initially, the
English-language mailing list was used by Japanese Rubyists writing in English,
but this gradually changed as awareness of Ruby grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Dave Thomas published &lt;em&gt;Programming Ruby&lt;/em&gt;, the first English-language
book to cover Ruby. The book became known as the &quot;pickaxe&quot; book for the pickaxe
it featured on its cover. It introduced Ruby to many programmers in the West
for the first time. Like it had in Japan, Ruby spread quickly, and by 2002 the
English-language Ruby mailing list had more traffic than the original
Japanese-language mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2005, Ruby had become more popular, but it was still not a mainstream
programming language. That changed with the release of Ruby on Rails. Ruby on
Rails was the &quot;killer app&quot; for Ruby, and it did more than any other project to
popularize Ruby. After the release of Ruby on Rails, interest in Ruby shot up
across the board, as measured by the TIOBE language index:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/tiobe_ruby.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s sometimes joked that the only programs anybody writes in Ruby are
Ruby-on-Rails web applications. That makes it sound as if Ruby on Rails
completely took over the Ruby community, which is only partly true. While Ruby
has certainly come to be known as that language people write Rails apps in,
Rails owes as much to Ruby as Ruby owes to Rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ruby philosophy heavily informed the design and implementation of Rails.
David Heinemeier Hansson, who created Rails, often talks about how his first
contact with Ruby was an almost religious experience. He has said that the
encounter was so transformative that it &quot;imbued him with a calling to do
missionary work in service of Matz&apos;s creation.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For Hansson, Ruby&apos;s
no-shackles approach was a politically courageous rebellion against the
top-down impositions made by languages like Python and Java. He appreciated
that the language trusted him and empowered him to make his own judgements
about how best to express his programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Matsumoto, Hansson claims that he created Rails out of a frustration with
the status quo and a desire to make things better for himself. He, like
Matsumoto, prioritized programmer happiness above all else, evaluating
additions to Rails by what he calls &quot;The Principle of The Bigger Smile.&quot;
Whatever made Hansson smile more was what made it into the Rails codebase.
As a result, Rails would come to include unorthodox features like the
&quot;Inflector&quot; class (which tries to map singular class names to plural database
table names automatically) and Rails&apos; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/code&gt; extensions (allowing programmers
to write cute expressions like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2.days.ago&lt;/code&gt;). To some, these features were
truly weird, but the success of Rails is testament to the number of people who
found it made their lives much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, while it might seem that Rails was an incidental application of Ruby
that happened to become extremely popular, Rails in fact embodies many of
Ruby&apos;s core principles. Futhermore, it&apos;s hard to see how Rails could have been
built in any other language, given its dependence on Ruby&apos;s macro-like class
method calls to implement things like model associations. Some people might
take the fact that so much of Ruby development revolves around Ruby on Rails as
a sign of an unhealthy ecosystem, but there are good reasons that Ruby and Ruby
on Rails are so intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People seem to have an inordinate amount of interest in whether or not Ruby
(and Ruby on Rails) are dying. Since as early as 2011, it seems that Stack
Overflow and Quora have been full of programmers asking whether or not they
should bother learning Ruby if it will no longer be around in the next few
years.  These concerns are not unjustified; according to the TIOBE index and to
Stack Overflow trends, Ruby and Ruby on Rails have been shrinking in
popularity.  Though Ruby on Rails was once the hot new thing, it has since been
eclipsed by hotter and newer frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory for why this has happened is that programmers are abandoning
dynamically typed languages for statically typed ones. Analysts at TIOBE index
figure that a rise in quality requirements have made runtime exceptions
increasingly unacceptable. They cite TypeScript as an example of this trend—a
whole new version of JavaScript was created just to ensure that client-side
code could be written with the benefit of compile-time safety guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more likely answer, I think, is just that Ruby on Rails now has many more
competitors than it once did. When Rails was first introduced in 2005, there
weren&apos;t that many ways to create web applications—the main alternative was
Java.  Today, you can create web applications using great frameworks built for
Go, JavaScript, or Python, to name only the most popular options. The web world
also seems to be moving toward a more distributed architecture for
applications, meaning that, rather than having one codebase responsible for
everything from database access to view rendering, responsibilites are split
between different components that focus on doing one thing well. Rails feels
overbroad and bloated for something as focused as a JSON API that talks to a
JavaScript frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, there are reasons to be optimistic about Ruby&apos;s future. Both
Rails and Ruby continue to be actively developed. Matsumoto and others are
working hard on Ruby&apos;s third major release, which they aim to make three times
faster than the existing version of Ruby, possibly alleviating the performance
concerns that have always dogged Ruby. And even if the world of web frameworks
has become more diverse since 2005, that doesn&apos;t mean that there won&apos;t always
be room for Ruby on Rails. It is now a mature tool with an enormous amount of
built-in power that will always be a good choice for certain kinds of
applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if Ruby and Rails go the way of the dinosaurs, one thing that seems
certain to survive is the Ruby ethos of programmer happiness. Ruby has had a
profound influence on the design of many new programming languages, which have
adopted many of its best ideas. Other new lanuages have tried to be &quot;more
modern&quot; interpretations of Ruby: Elixir, for example, is a version of Ruby that
emphasizes the functional programming paradigm, while Crystal, which is still
in development, aims to be a statically typed version of Ruby. Many programmers
around the world have fallen in love with Ruby and its syntax, so we can count
on its influence persisting for a long while to come.&lt;/p&gt;

decade, inspiring a heroic engineering effort that culminated in Neil
Armstrong&apos;s first steps on the lunar surface. Many of the fruits of this
engineering effort were highly visible and sexy—there were new spacecraft, new
spacesuits, and moon buggies. But the Apollo Program was so staggeringly
complex that new technologies had to be invented even to do the mundane things.
One of these technologies was IBM&apos;s Information Management System (IMS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMS is a database management system. NASA needed one in order to keep track of
all the parts that went into building a Saturn V rocket, which—because there
were two million of them—was expected to be a challenge. Databases were a new
idea in the 1960s and there weren&apos;t any already available for NASA to use, so,
in 1965, NASA asked IBM to work with North American Aviation and Caterpillar
Tractor to create one. By 1968, IBM had installed a working version of IMS at
NASA, though at the time it was called ICS/DL/I for &quot;Informational Control
System and Data Language/Interface.&quot; (IBM seems to have gone through a brief,
unfortunate infatuation with the slash; see
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I&quot;&gt;PL/I&lt;/a&gt;.) Two years later, IBM rebranded
ICS/DL/I as &quot;IMS&quot; and began selling it to other customers. It was one of the
first commercially available database management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incredible thing about IMS is that it is still in use today. And not just
on a small scale: Banks, insurance companies, hospitals, and government
agencies still use IMS for all sorts of critical tasks. Over 95% of Fortune
1000 companies use IMS in some capacity, as do all of the top five US
banks.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Whenever you withdraw cash from an ATM, the odds are exceedingly
good that you are interacting with IMS at some point in the course of your
transaction. In a world where the relational database is an old workhorse
increasingly in competition with trendy new NoSQL databases, IMS is a freaking
dinosaur. It is a relic from an era before the relational database was even
invented, which didn&apos;t happen until 1970. And yet it seems to be the database
system in charge of all the important stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this makes IMS pretty interesting. Depending on how you feel about
relational databases, it either offers insight into how the relational model
improved on its predecessors or else exemplifies an alternative model better
suited to certain problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMS works according to a hierarchical model, meaning that, instead of thinking
about data as tables that can be brought together using JOIN operations, IMS
thinks about data as trees. Each kind of record you store can have other kinds
of records as children; these child record types represent additional
information that you might be interested in given a record of the parent type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take an example, say that you want to store information about bank
customers. You might have one type of record to represent customers and another
type of record to represent accounts. Like in a relational database, where each
table has columns, these records will have different fields; we might want to
have a first name field, a last name field, and a city field for each customer.
We must then decide whether we are likely to first lookup a customer and then
information about that customer&apos;s account, or whether we are likely to first
lookup an account and then information about that account&apos;s owner. Assuming we
decide that we will access customers first, then we will make our account
record type a child of our customer record type. Diagrammed, our database model
would look something like this:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/hierarchical-model.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an actual database might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/hierarchical-db.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By modeling our data this way, we are hewing close to the reality of how our
data is stored. Each parent record includes pointers to its children, meaning
that moving down our tree from the root node is efficient. (Actually, each
parent basically stores just one pointer to the first of its children. The
children in turn contain pointers to their siblings. This ensures that the size
of a record does not vary with the number of children it has.) This efficiency
can make data accesses very fast, provided that we are accessing our data in
ways that we anticipated when we first structured our database. According to
IBM, an IMS instance can process over 100,000 transactions a second, which is
probably a large part of why IMS is still used, particularly at banks.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But
the downside is that we have lost a lot of flexibility. If we want to access
our data in ways we did not anticipate, we will have a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, consider what might happen if we decide that we would like
to access accounts before customers. Perhaps customers are calling in to update
their addresses, and we would like them to uniquely identify themselves using
their account numbers. So we want to use an account number to find an account,
and then from there find the account&apos;s owner. But since all accesses start at
the root of our tree, there&apos;s no way for us to get to an account efficiently
without first deciding on a customer. To fix this problem, we could introduce a
second tree or hierarchy starting with account records; these account records
would then have customer records as children. This would let us access accounts
and then customers efficiently. But it would involve duplicating information
that we already have stored in our database—we would have two trees storing the
same information in different orders. Another option would be to establish an
index of accounts that could point us to the right account record given an
account number. That would work too, but it would entail extra work during
insert and update operations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was precisely this inflexibility and the problem of duplicated information
that pushed E. F. Codd to propose the relational model. In his 1970 paper, &lt;em&gt;A
Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks&lt;/em&gt;, he states at the outset
that he intends to present a model for data storage that can protect users from
having to know anything about how their data is stored. Looked at one way, the
hierarchical model is entirely an artifact of how the designers of IMS chose to
store data. It is a &lt;em&gt;bottom-up&lt;/em&gt; model, the implication of a physical reality.
The relational model, on the other hand, is an abstract model based on
relational algebra, and is &lt;em&gt;top-down&lt;/em&gt; in that the data storage scheme can be
anything provided it accommodates the model. The relational model&apos;s great
advantage is that, just because you&apos;ve made decisions that have caused the
database to store your data in a particular way, you won&apos;t find yourself
effectively unable to make certain queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, the relational model is an abstraction, and we all know
abstractions aren&apos;t free. Banks and large institutions have stuck with IMS
partly because of the performance benefits, though it&apos;s hard to say if those
benefits would be enough to keep them from switching to a modern database if
they weren&apos;t also trying to avoid rewriting mission-critical legacy code.
However, today&apos;s popular NoSQL databases demonstrate that there are people
willing to drop the conveniences of the relational model in return for better
performance. Something like MongoDB, which encourages its users to store data
in a denormalized form, isn&apos;t all that different from IMS. If you choose to
store some entity inside of another JSON record, then in effect you have
created something like the IMS hierarchy, and you have constrained your ability
to query for that data in the future. But perhaps that&apos;s a tradeoff you&apos;re
willing to make. So, even if IMS hadn&apos;t predated E. F. Codd&apos;s relational model
by several years, there are still reasons why IMS&apos; creators might not have
adopted the relational model wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, IMS isn&apos;t something that you can download and take for a spin on
your own computer. First of all, IMS is not free, so you would have to buy it
from IBM. But the bigger problem is that IMS only runs on IBM mainframes like
the IBM z13. That&apos;s a shame, because it would be a joy to play around with IMS
and get a sense for exactly how it differs from something like MySQL. But even
without that opportunity, it&apos;s interesting to think about software systems that
work in ways we don&apos;t expect or aren&apos;t used to. And it&apos;s especially interesting
when those systems, alien as they are, turn out to undergird your local
hospital, the entire financial sector, and even the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

Formatted as strangely as they are and
accessible primarily through the terminal, they have always felt to me like
relics of an ancient past. Some man pages probably &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; ancient: I&apos;d love to
know how many times the man page for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; or say &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tee&lt;/code&gt; has been revised since
the early days of Unix, but I&apos;m willing to bet it&apos;s not many. Man pages are
mysterious—it&apos;s not obvious where they come from, where they live on your
computer, or what kind of file they might be stored in—and yet it&apos;s hard to
believe that something so fundamental and so obviously governed by rigid
conventions could remain so inscrutable. Where did the man page conventions
come from? Where are they codified? If I wanted to write my own man page, where
would I even begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; is inextricably tied to the story of Unix. The very first
version of Unix, completed in 1971 but only available internally at Bell Labs,
did not provide a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; command. But Douglas McIlroy, who at the time was head
of the Computing Techniques Research Department and managed the Unix project,
insisted that some kind of documentation be made available.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He pushed Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the two programmers commonly credited with
creating Unix, to write some. The result was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html&quot;&gt;first
edition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Unix
Programmer&apos;s Manual&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first edition of the &lt;em&gt;Unix Programmer&apos;s Manual&lt;/em&gt; consisted of (physical!)
pages collected together in a single binder. It documented only 61 different
commands, along with a couple dozen system calls and a few library routines.
Though the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; command itself was not to come until later, the first edition
of the &lt;em&gt;Unix Programmer&apos;s Manual&lt;/em&gt; established many of the conventions that man
pages adhere to today, even in the absence of an official specification. The
documentation for each command included the well-known NAME, SYNOPSIS,
DESCRIPTION, and SEE ALSO headings. Optional flags were enclosed in square
brackets and meta-arguments (for example, &quot;file&quot; where a file path is expected)
were underlined. The manual also established the canonical manual sections such
as Section 1 for General Commands, Section 2 for System Calls, and so on; these
sections were, at the time, simply sections of a very long printed document.
Thompson and Ritchie could not have known that they were establishing a
tradition that would survive for decades and decades, but that is what they
did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McIlroy later speculated about why the man page format has survived as long as
it has. In a technical report about the conceptual development of Unix, he
noted that the original man pages were written in a &quot;terse, yet informal, prose
style&quot; that together with the alphabetical ordering of information &quot;encouraged
accurate on-line documentation.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a nod to an experience with man pages
that all programmers have had at one time or another, he added that the man
page format &quot;was popular with initiates who needed to look up facts, albeit
sometimes frustrating for beginners who didn&apos;t know what facts to look for.&quot;
McIlroy was highlighting the sometimes-overlooked distinction between tutorial
and reference; man pages may not be much use for the former, but they are
perfect for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; command was a part of Unix by the time the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/att/unix/2nd_Edition/UNIX_Programmers_Manual_2ed_Jun72.pdf&quot;&gt;second
edition&lt;/a&gt;
of the &lt;em&gt;Unix Programmer&apos;s Manual&lt;/em&gt; was printed. It made the entire manual
available &quot;on-line&quot;, meaning interactively, which was seen as enormously
useful. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; command has its own manual page in the second edition (this
page is the original &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man man&lt;/code&gt;), which explains that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; can be used to &quot;run
off a particular section of this manual.&quot; Among the original Unix wizards, the
term &quot;run off&quot; referred to the physical act of printing a document but also to
the program they used to typeset documents, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; program had been
used to typeset both the first and second editions of the &lt;em&gt;Unix Programmer&apos;s
Manual&lt;/em&gt; before they were printed, but it was now also used by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; to process
man pages before they were displayed. The man pages themselves were stored on
every Unix system in a file format meant to be read by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; was the first in a long lineage of typesetting programs that have always
been used to format man pages. Its own development can be traced back to a
program called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RUNOFF&lt;/code&gt; that was written in the mid-60s. At Bell Labs, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt;
spawned several successors including &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nroff&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;en-roff&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;troff&lt;/code&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;tee-roff&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nroff&lt;/code&gt; was designed to improve on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; and better output text
to terminals, while &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;troff&lt;/code&gt; tackled the problem of printing using a CAT
phototypesetter. (If you don&apos;t know what phototypesetting is, as I did not, I
refer you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/127605644&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; eminently watchable film.) All
of these programs were based on a kind of markup language consisting of
two-letter commands inserted at the beginning of every line in a document.
These commands could control such things as font size, text positioning, line
spacing, and so on. Today, the most common implementation of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; system
is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;groff&lt;/code&gt;, a part of the GNU project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s easy to get a sense of what &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; input files look like by just taking a
gander at some of the man pages stored on your own computer. At least on a
BSD-derived system like MacOS, you can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--path&lt;/code&gt; argument to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; to
find out where the man page for a particular command is stored. Typically this
will be under &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/usr/share/man&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/usr/local/share/man&lt;/code&gt;. Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; this way,
you can find the path for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; man page itself and then open it in a text
editor. It will not look anything like what you&apos;re used to looking at with
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;. On my system, the first couple dozen lines are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.TH man 1 &amp;quot;September 19, 2005&amp;quot;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B man
formats and displays the on-line manual pages.  If you specify
.IR section ,
.B man
only looks in that section of the manual.
.I name
is normally the name of the manual page, which is typically the name
of a command, function, or file.
However, if
.I name
contains a slash
.RB ( / )
then
.B man
interprets it as a file specification, so that you can do
.B &amp;quot;man ./foo.5&amp;quot;
or even
.B &amp;quot;man /cd/foo/bar.1.gz\fR.\fP&amp;quot;
.PP
See below for a description of where
.B man
looks for the manual page files.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make out, for example, that all of the section headings are preceded by
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.SH&lt;/code&gt;, and everything that would appear in bold is preceded by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.B&lt;/code&gt;. These
commands are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; macros specifically designed for writing man pages. The
macros used here are part of a package called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;, but there are other
packages such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mdoc&lt;/code&gt; that you can use for the same purpose. The macros make
writing man pages much simpler than it would otherwise be. They also enforce
consistency by always compiling down to the same set of lower-level &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt;
commands. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mdoc&lt;/code&gt; packages are now documented under
&lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man.7.html&quot;&gt;GROFF_MAN(7)&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_mdoc.7.html&quot;&gt;GROFF_MDOC(7)&lt;/a&gt;
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; system is reminiscent of LaTeX, another typesetting tool that
today enjoys much more popularity. LaTeX is essentially a big bucket of macros
built on top of the core TeX system designed by Donald Knuth. Like with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt;,
there are many other macro packages that you can incorporate into your LaTeX
documents. These macro packages mean that you almost never have to write raw
TeX yourself. LaTeX has superseded &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; in many domains, but it is poorly
suited to formatting text for a terminal, so nobody uses it to write man pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to write a man page today, in 2017, how would you go about it? You
certainly &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; write a man page using a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; macro package like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mdoc&lt;/code&gt;. The syntax is unfamiliar and unwieldy. But the macros abstract away so
much of the complexity that you can write a reasonably complete man page
without learning very many commands. That said, there are now other options
worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; is a widely used software tool for converting
documents from one format to another. You can use Pandoc to convert Markdown
files into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;-macro-based man pages, meaning that you can now write your man
pages in something as straightforward as Markdown. Pandoc supports many more
Markdown constructs than most Markdown converters, giving you lots of ways to
format your man page. While this convenience comes at the cost of some control,
it&apos;s unlikely that you will ever need something that would warrant dropping
down to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; macro level. If you&apos;re curious about what these Markdown
files might look like, I&apos;ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um/tree/02365bd0c0a229efb936b3d6234294e512e8a218/doc&quot;&gt;a few of my
own&lt;/a&gt;
to document a tool I created for keeping notes on how to use different
command-line utilities. NPM&apos;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/20589f4b028d3e8a617800ac6289d27f39e548e8/doc/cli/npm.md&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;
is also written in Markdown and converted to a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;roff&lt;/code&gt; man format later, though
they use a JavaScript package called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked-man&quot;&gt;marked-man&lt;/a&gt; instead of Pandoc to do
the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are now plenty of ways to write man pages, giving you lots of freedom
to choose the tool you think best. That said, you&apos;d better ensure that your man
page &lt;em&gt;reads like every other man page that has ever been written&lt;/em&gt;. Even though
there is now so much flexibility in tooling, the man page conventions are as
strong as ever. And you might be tempted to skip writing a man page
altogether—after all, you probably have documentation on the web, or maybe you
just want to rely on the &lt;span class=&quot;nobr&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flag—but you&apos;re
forgoing the patina of respectability a man page can provide. The man page is
an institution that doesn&apos;t seem likely to disappear or evolve soon, which is
fascinating, because there are so many ways in which we could do man pages
better. XML didn&apos;t come off well in my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/series/2bithistory/the-rise-and-rise-of-json.&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;,
but it would be the perfect format here, and it would allow us to do something
like query &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; about an option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ man grep -v
Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified patterns.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that! But it seems that we&apos;re all too used to man pages the way they
are. In a field where rapid change is the norm, maybe some
stability—particularly in a documentation system we all turn to in moments of
ignorance and confusion—is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, when any two applications communicate
with each other across the internet, odds are they do so using JSON. It has
been adopted by all the big players: Of the ten most popular web APIs, a list
consisting mostly of APIs offered by major companies like Google, Facebook, and
Twitter, only one API exposes data in XML rather than JSON.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Twitter, to
take an illustrative example from that list, supported XML until 2013, when it
released a new version of its API that dropped XML in favor of using JSON
exclusively. JSON has also been widely adopted by the programming rank and
file: According to Stack Overflow, a question and answer site for programmers,
more questions are now asked about JSON than about any other data interchange
format.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/2bithistory/json.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML still survives in many places. It is used across the web for SVGs and for
RSS and Atom feeds. When Android developers want to declare that their app
requires a permission from the user, they do so in their app&apos;s manifest, which
is written in XML. XML also isn&apos;t the only alternative to JSON—some people now
use technologies like YAML or Google&apos;s Protocol Buffers. But these are nowhere
near as popular as JSON. For the time being, JSON appears to be the go-to
format for communicating with other programs over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON&apos;s dominance is surprising when you consider that as recently as 2005 the
web world was salivating over the potential of &quot;Asynchronous JavaScript and
XML&quot; and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &quot;Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON.&quot; It is of course possible
that this had nothing to do with the relative popularity of the two formats at
the time and reflects only that &quot;AJAX&quot; must have seemed a more appealing
acronym than &quot;AJAJ.&quot; But even if some people were already using JSON instead of
XML in 2005 (and in fact not many people were yet), one still wonders how XML&apos;s
fortunes could have declined so precipitously that a mere decade or so later
&quot;Asynchronous JavaScript and XML&quot; has become an ironic misnomer. What happened
in that decade? How did JSON supersede XML in so many applications? And who
came up with this data format now depended on by engineers and systems all over
the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Birth of JSON&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first JSON message was sent in April of 2001. Since this was a historically
significant moment in computing, the message was sent from a computer in a
Bay-Area garage. Douglas Crockford and Chip Morningstar, co-founders of a
technology consulting company called State Software, had gathered in
Morningstar&apos;s garage to test out an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crockford and Morningstar were trying to build AJAX applications well before
the term &quot;AJAX&quot; had been coined. Browser support for what they were attempting
was not good. They wanted to pass data to their application after the initial
page load, but they had not found a way to do this that would work across all
the browsers they were targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it&apos;s hard to believe today, Internet Explorer represented the bleeding
edge of web browsing in 2001. As early as 1999, Internet Explorer 5 supported a
primordial form of XMLHttpRequest, which programmers could access using a
framework called ActiveX. Crockford and Morningstar could have used this
technology to fetch data for their application, but they could not have used
the same solution in Netscape 4, another browser that they sought to support.
So Crockford and Morningstar had to use a different system that worked in both
browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first JSON message looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
    document.domain = &amp;#39;fudco&amp;#39;;
    parent.session.receive(
        { to: &amp;quot;session&amp;quot;, do: &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;,
          text: &amp;quot;Hello world&amp;quot; }
    )
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a small part of the message resembles JSON as we know it today. The
message itself is actually an HTML document containing some JavaScript. The
part that resembles JSON is just a JavaScript object literal being passed to a
function called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;receive()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crockford and Morningstar had decided that they could abuse an HTML frame to
send themselves data. They could point a frame at a URL that would return an
HTML document like the one above.  When the HTML was received, the JavaScript
would be run, passing the object literal back to the application. This worked
as long as you were careful to sidestep browser protections preventing a
sub-window from accessing its parent; you can see that Crockford and
Mornginstar did that by explicitly setting the document domain. (This
frame-based technique, sometimes called the hidden frame technique, was
commonly used in the late 90s before the widespread implementation of
XMLHttpRequest.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing thing about the first JSON message is that it&apos;s not obviously the
first usage of a new kind of data format at all. It&apos;s just JavaScript!  In fact
the idea of using JavaScript this way is so straightforward that Crockford
himself has said that he wasn&apos;t the first person to do it—he claims that
somebody at Netscape was using JavaScript array literals to communicate
information as early as 1996.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since the message is just JavaScript, it
doesn&apos;t require any kind of special parsing. The JavaScript interpreter can do
it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ever JSON message actually ran afoul of the JavaScript interpreter.
JavaScript reserves an enormous number of words—there are 64 reserved words as
of ECMAScript 6—and Crockford and Morningstar had unwittingly used one in their
message. They had used &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; as a key, but &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; is reserved. Since JavaScript
has so many reserved words, Crockford decided that, rather than avoid using all
those reserved words, he would just mandate that all JSON keys be quoted. A
quoted key would be treated as a string by the JavaScript interpreter, meaning
that reserved words could be used safely. This is why JSON keys are quoted to
this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crockford and Morningstar realized they had something that could be used in all
sorts of applications. They wanted to name their format &quot;JSML&quot;, for JavaScript
Markup Language, but found that the acronym was already being used for
something called Java Speech Markup Language. So they decided to go with
&quot;JavaScript Object Notation&quot;, or JSON. They began pitching it to clients but
soon found that clients were unwilling to take a chance on an unknown
technology that lacked an official specification.  So Crockford decided he
would write one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Crockford bought the domain &lt;a href=&quot;http://JSON.org&quot;&gt;JSON.org&lt;/a&gt; and put up the
JSON grammar and an example implementation of a parser. The website is still
up, though it now includes a prominent link to the JSON ECMA standard ratified
in 2013. After putting up the website, Crockford did little more to promote
JSON, but soon found that lots of people were submitting JSON parser
implementations in all sorts of different programming languages. JSON&apos;s lineage
clearly tied it to JavaScript, but it became apparent that JSON was well-suited
to data interchange between arbitrary pairs of languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing AJAX Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON got a big boost in 2005.  That year, a web designer and developer named
Jesse James Garrett coined the term &quot;AJAX&quot; in a blog post.  He was careful to
stress that AJAX wasn&apos;t any one new technology, but rather &quot;several
technologies, each flourishing in its own right, coming together in powerful
new ways.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; AJAX was the name that Garrett was giving to a new approach to
web application development that he had noticed gaining favor.  His blog post
went on to describe how developers could leverage JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest
to build new kinds of applications that were more responsive and stateful than
the typical web page. He pointed to Gmail and Flickr as examples of websites
already relying on AJAX techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;X&quot; in &quot;AJAX&quot; stood for XML, of course. But in a follow-up Q&amp;#x26;A post,
Garrett pointed to JSON as an entirely acceptable alternative to XML. He wrote
that &quot;XML is the most fully-developed means of getting data in and out of an
AJAX client, but there&apos;s no reason you couldn&apos;t accomplish the same effects
using a technology like JavaScript Object Notation or any similar means of
structuring data.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers indeed found that they could easily use JSON to build AJAX
applications and many came to prefer it to XML. And so, ironically, the
interest in AJAX led to an explosion in JSON&apos;s popularity. It was around this
time that JSON drew the attention of the blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Dave Winer, a prolific blogger and the engineer behind a number of
XML-based technologies such as RSS and XML-RPC, complained that JSON was
reinventing XML for no good reason.  Though one might think that a contest
between data interchange formats would be unlikely to engender death threats,
Winer wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt I can write a routine to parse [JSON], but look at how deep they
went to re-invent, XML itself wasn&apos;t good enough for them, for some reason
(I&apos;d love to hear the reason). Who did this travesty? Let&apos;s find a tree and
string them up. Now.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s easy to understand Winer&apos;s frustration. XML has never been widely loved.
Even Winer has said that he does not love XML.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But XML was designed to be a
system that could be used by everyone for almost anything imaginable. To that
end, XML is actually a meta-language that allows you to define domain-specific
languages for individual applications—RSS, the web feed technology, and SOAP
(Simple Object Access Protocol) are examples. Winer felt that it was important
to work toward consensus because of all the benefits a common interchange
format could bring. He felt that XML&apos;s flexibility should be able to
accommodate everybody&apos;s needs. And yet here was JSON, a format offering no
benefits over XML except those enabled by throwing out the cruft that made XML
so flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crockford saw Winer&apos;s blog post and left a comment on it. In response to the
charge that JSON was reinventing XML, Crockford wrote, &quot;The good thing about
reinventing the wheel is that you can get a round one.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JSON vs XML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2014, JSON had been officially specified by both an ECMA standard and an
RFC. It had its own MIME type. JSON had made it to the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did JSON become so much more popular than XML?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://JSON.org&quot;&gt;JSON.org&lt;/a&gt;, Crockford summarizes some of JSON&apos;s advantages
over XML. He writes that JSON is easier for both humans and machines to
understand, since its syntax is minimal and its structure is predictable.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Other bloggers have focused on XML&apos;s verbosity and &quot;the angle bracket
tax.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-11&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Each opening tag in XML must be matched with a closing tag, meaning
that an XML document contains a lot of redundant information. This can make an
XML document much larger than an equivalent JSON document when uncompressed,
but, perhaps more importantly, it also makes an XML document harder to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crockford has also claimed that another enormous advantage for JSON is that
JSON was designed as a data interchange format.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-12&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was meant to carry
structured information between programs from the very beginning. XML, though it
has been used for the same purpose, was originally designed as a document
markup language. It evolved from SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language),
which in turn evolved from a markup language called Scribe, intended as a word
processing system similar to LaTeX. In XML, a tag can contain what is called
&quot;mixed content,&quot; or text with inline tags surrounding words or phrases. This
recalls the image of an editor marking up a manuscript with a red or blue pen,
which is arguably the central metaphor of a markup language. JSON, on the other
hand, does not support a clear analogue to mixed content, but that means that
its structure can be simpler.  A document is best modeled as a tree, but by
throwing out the document idea Crockford could limit JSON to dictionaries and
arrays, the basic and familiar elements all programmers use to build their
programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my own hunch is that people disliked XML because it was confusing, and
it was confusing because it seemed to come in so many different flavors. At
first blush, it&apos;s not obvious where the line is between XML proper and its
sub-languages like RSS, ATOM, SOAP, or SVG. The first lines of a typical XML
document establish the XML version and then the particular sub-language the XML
document should conform to.  That is a lot of variation to account for already,
especially when compared to JSON, which is so straightforward that no new
version of the JSON specification is ever expected to be written. The designers
of XML, in their attempt to make XML the one data interchange format to rule
them all, fell victim to that classic programmer&apos;s pitfall: over-engineering.
XML was so generalized that it was hard to use for something simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, a campaign was launched to get HTML to conform to the XML standard. A
specification was published for XML-compliant HTML, thereafter known as XHTML.
Some browser vendors immediately started supporting the new standard, but it
quickly became obvious that the vast HTML-producing public were unwilling to
revise their habits. The new standard called for stricter validation of XHTML
than had been the norm for HTML, but too many websites depended on HTML&apos;s
forgiving rules. By 2009, an attempt to write a second version of the XHTML
standard was aborted when it became clear that the future of HTML was going to
be HTML5, a standard that did not insist on XML compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the XHTML effort had succeeded, then maybe XML would have become the common
data format that its designers hoped it would be. Imagine a world in which HTML
documents and API responses had the exact same structure. In such a world, JSON
might not have become as ubiquitous as it is today. But I read the failure of
XHTML as a kind of moral defeat for the XML camp. If XML wasn&apos;t the best tool
for HTML, then maybe there were better tools out there for other applications
also. In that world, our world, it is easy to see how a format as simple and
narrowly tailored as JSON could find great success.&lt;/p&gt;

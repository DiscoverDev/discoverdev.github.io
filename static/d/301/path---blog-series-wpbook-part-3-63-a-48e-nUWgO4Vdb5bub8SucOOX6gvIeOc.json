It was unclear what it took to become a committer or a lead developer. Instead, the roles developed organically. For the community, authority naturally followed commit access to the repository, and commit access followed high-quality code submissions along with an understanding of and commitment to the project ethos. Commit is a symbol of trust; with only two committers, it appeared that the project leads did not trust others in the community.

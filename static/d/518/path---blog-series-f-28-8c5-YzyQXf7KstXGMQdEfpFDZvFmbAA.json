Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie began writing Unix on a PDP 7. This was in 1969, before C, so all of the early Unix software was written in PDP 7 assembly. The first implementation of cat is thus in PDP 7 assembly. See how cat evolved from the 1960s PDP implementation to how it is today.\n"}}},{"node":{"id":"b31740a7-1bc3-5483-bae7-ce9497f1bfdb","fields":{"slug":"/blog/series/2bithistory/lisp/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How Lisp Became God's Own Programming Language","date":"14 October, 2018","desc":"A look at the fascinating history behind the one programming language with magical powers. \"John McCarthy, Lisp's creator, did not originally intend for Lisp to be an elegant distillation of the principles of computation.

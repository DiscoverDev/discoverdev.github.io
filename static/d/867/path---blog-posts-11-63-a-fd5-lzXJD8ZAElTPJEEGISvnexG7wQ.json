Edgar Codd, a researcher at IBM, published a paper called \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.\" The paper is unassuming; Codd only claims to have employed a  novel tool (the mathematical notion of a \"relation\") to address some of the inadequacies of the prevailing database models.\n","categories":null},"excerpt":"It's hard to believe today, but the relational database was once the cool new\nkid on the block.

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie began writing Unix on a PDP 7. This was in 1969, before C, so all of the early Unix software was written in PDP 7 assembly. The first implementation of cat is thus in PDP 7 assembly. See how cat evolved from the 1960s PDP implementation to how it is today.\n"},"excerpt":"I once had a debate with members of my extended family about whether a computer\nscience degree is a degree worth pursuing.
